## Description

Set 6 ruby sapphire can be build in multiple ways depending on the to be expected meta. In areas where there is more aggression usually a combination of Sisu, Ice Blocks is being found, eventually including as well Human Sisu or the Daring Visitor to have a shift on six ink. Common to all builds is the usage of Tipo and Sail the Azurite Sea as ramp cards on turn 2.

Using Sail requires the additional card to be inkable, which has let to a shift of the build to reduce the number of uninkable cards to ensure a consistent ramp - this is still the key for success. If you do not have ramp on turn two it's usually a very nasty game with an uphill battle to win.

Set 5 ruby sapphire is build to deal with the evolved meta of a mixture of control and discard decks. Aggro decks are no longer as popular as they have been at the beginning of the set, so consistency matters more than being able to deal with early threats. Especially for the mirror match the inclusion of four Maleficent - Monstrous Dragon are very rewarding. The item/ location destruction action Hide Away is very good in the mirror match or in Ruby Amethyst matches to deal with the Queens Castle. It's still important to ramp on turn two while being on the draw, on the play a setup with Chicha and then Tipo to additionally draw a card may be fast enough.
