## Description

Set 8 ruby sapphire midrange deck builds upon the set 7 meta game including the Maui Half-Shark as way to control the board and gain lore. At the same time the McDuck Manor is included as secondary attack vector or to force excertion of characters for attack to allow the shark to trade back/ regain actions from the discard.

Inclusion of the Merlin's Capet Bag as this item outperforms especially in the mirror match and increases the usage of Pawpsicles for gaining card advantage. For the same purpose the Tamatoa cards are still included as four ofs in the deck. The one of Vitalisphere allows for surprise trade ins with the shark and have another item to regain with the carpet bag.

Single target removal are done using Hades as direct answer for an opposing shark and the large red dragon as absolute top end allowing a removal without ramping the opponent in addition.

The Goofy Super-Goof cards are mainly included as answers to aggressive starts and as well as closing options to have additional lore gained from unexpected challenges.
