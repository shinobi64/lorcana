## Description

Set 7 Ruby Sapphire can be build in multiple ways - dependent on the dominant/ to be expected meta. Especially in the beginning there are more aggressive variants of Sapphire Steel present which abuse the Belle on turn 1 for banishment of an item.

Main aspects of the set 7 influence can be seen around the following cards

- Sapphire Coil - enables more targeted removal by Brawl, Madame Medusa, Human Sisu and Big Sisu - at the expense of having to ink
- Scrooge McDuck - a 4/4 body which can be played out for "free" should not be disrespected - however it requires a good number of items to allow him to be effective and not drop good cards under the bottom of the deck
- Tamatoa Happy as a Clam - severe impact as it brings back items from the discard to allow a further loop of Pawpsicles into Flaversham

Set 6 ruby sapphire can be build in multiple ways depending on the to be expected meta. In areas where there is more aggression usually a combination of Sisu, Ice Blocks is being found, eventually including as well Human Sisu or the Daring Visitor to have a shift on six ink. Common to all builds is the usage of Tipo and Sail the Azurite Sea as ramp cards on turn 2.

Using Sail requires the additional card to be inkable, which has let to a shift of the build to reduce the number of uninkable cards to ensure a consistent ramp - this is still the key for success. If you do not have ramp on turn two it's usually a very nasty game with an uphill battle to win.

Depending on the specific build and meta expectations the number of uninkable cards is moving betwen 8 (as kind of lowest number) and around 15 (as commonly accepted current maximum). With regards to the expected meta - aggressive decks, e.g. the Brendon DeCandio Diggy Diggy Hole deck are very popular and have prooved that they have some legs. Especially the decks which contain some control options and are not just turn your cards sideways proove to be challenging.

Cards which are debateable

- Let it Go is acting as some kind of last resort solver to clear out an opposing threat for which no other option is currently available.
- Gaston - Arrogant Hunter is an option to counter early aggression as it's available to trade into Daisy and has sufficient strength to contest opposing Flynns.
- Ice Block and Sisu form a package which always goes together, as without Ice Block Sisu just does not hit enough targets and the Ice Blocks allow an efficient trade as well into the Lilo which is able to be brought back from the discard.
- Scar - Vicious Cheater could act as a one off kind of board wipe which can come down a turn earlier than Sisu and usually trade efficiently into aggressive boards as well
- Maui's Fish Hook as additional item to gain value from the included Mauis to allow other characters getting evasive to either stay safe despite questing or to challenge opposing evasive characters, e.g. Genie. The hook is as well good into more location heavy decks due to the typically high willpower on locations
- King Candy as one drop and shift King Candy as alternative to Gramma Tala - effect of the larger King Candy is similar to Gramma with the upside you can keep the two new cards and discard one from your current hand. If King Candy line is included then it makes sense to play as well Let it Go as a more reliable singer line is then established.
- Mulan - Elite Archer as alternative into aggressive decks, in that combination it's usually required to increase the number of Vitalisphere cards to increase the strength of Mulan and gain more damage from her effect. This can then be a very good option as well on seven ink, which may surprise some opponents.
- Mulan - Soldier in Training as rush 4 cost with 4 strenght and 3 willpower is filling a similar slot as Gaston - Arrogant Hunter with the upside of having rush but the downside of double the cost and the uninkability - which makes it less versatile, especially into match ups where it's not needed.
- Great Stone Dragon - as good item card into mirror matches or into grindy Ruby Amehtyst matches with a lot of board wipes to convert the discard back into useable ressources
- Tamatoa - So Shiny is a good option for recycling the items like Pawpsicle and Ice Block or Vitalisphere, however with a low item count the impact is not as high. It's a very good and needed card into the mirror matches.
- Queen of Hearts - Impulsive Ruler as other early rush option to challenge into aggressive boards. Drawback is that this would be good on turn two - which is usually the main ramp turn.
- Develop your Brain is already included but could be seen in an increased number, this would rather play into a gameplan that makes more use of the ability of Maui Half Shark to gain lore from playing actions. Into a more steel heavy meta where Pete is limiting action usage this is less effective.
- Pirate's Life is a needed card to claw back the lore lead from the opponent. Into more Amethyst heavy metas a higher number than two would be recommended to offset the reach of Amethyst with cards like Goat or White Rose.
