## Description

The set 5 emerald steel discard deck is an evolution of the Bucky discard set from set 4. It still has the core discard package with Sudden Chill, Hypnotize and Prince John included. Diablo is still a viable threat and Morph acts as variable shift target for Diablo, Beast or Tinkerbell. Hidden Cove is added as additional level of protection for Diablo and Beast against common threats. Muses is the final addition in the deck to create some second engine next to discard which allows for either tempo control the opponent or rebounce own characters to protect them after exposure.
