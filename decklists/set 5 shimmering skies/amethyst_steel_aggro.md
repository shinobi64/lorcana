## Description

The set 5 amethyst steel deck is build around the idea to go as quick as possible but do not run out of cards. The new cards included are Pete for controlling opposite actions and songs, Doc for refilling the hand, the Library for taking card draws out of your banished cards and the burn card Gathering Knowledge and Wisdom. The main idea is to play to the board and quest ahead, so that each card at least quests for one. Interrupt the opponents tempo with Befuddle and Fire the Canons. Bounce around the Doc to constantly refill your hand with new cards to play. The burn card is intended together with Merlin Goat to have reach at the end.
