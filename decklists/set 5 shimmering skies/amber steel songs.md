## Description

The set 5 amber steel song list gains only few modifications compared to previous set, especially Daisy adds some more early pressure and Prince Naveen allows for unexpected additional actions. Besides that the game plan remains the same, bring out characters, go wide and utilize the singing ability to get more out of the existing resources. Card draw is still mainly based on whole new world, but is backed up by Rapunzel. Shift Cinderrella is as well a late game threat where most decks will have a hard time dealing with her.
