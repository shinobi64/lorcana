## Mulligan Strategy

### Blind Mulligan

Blind mulligan is most important with around 50% of the cases, as for the beginning of a new match you do not know about your opponents deck. As well the bling mulligan strategy is still valid for all matches and the specific match requires minor adjustments.

Priority 1: Have ramp on turn two
This can either be Tipo or One Jump Ahead - ideally you have both to allow flexibility for the matchup or play Tipo on two and then let him sing One Jump on three. If there is no turn two ramp available this may often mean to mulligan aggressively by putting back all seven cards.

Priority 2: Look for a one drop
Best possible one drop is Popsticle as is replaces itself, alternative can as well be an IceBlock or a Vitalisphere. Especially look for Popsticle together with Fishbone Quill if you have not yet found the turn two ramp cards.

Priority 3: Look for turn three play
Turn three play is usually with 4 ink active, means here we have the choice between Flaversham, Grandma Tala or How Far I'll go. The specific best card is then dependent on the matchup, as in some cases one or the other may be better.

If turn two ramp cards are available and turn three play cards are available usually keep inkable cards as the deck has a lot of uninkables which can screw you if you throw them back. This may lead to cases where you may keep a Tamatoa or a Maleficent Dragon as ink, despite you rather would like to see them later in the game. However the chances of throwing them back and making your starting hand worse are higher and may cost you the game in total.

### Specific considerations

In Emerald matches on the draw you rather not keeping One Jump as the chances the opponent will play an Ursula on turn two is pretty high and then the song is gone. Mitigation can be to keep two One Jumps if you have them.

In Amber matches you should either put back the Fishbone Quill or keep two of them to ensure you're not getting punished by Bare Necessities play. In Amber Steel matches you decide between Tipo and One Jump depending on what the opponent plays - if they open with Cinderella, then rather go for One Jump, if they open otherwise go with Tipo.

Grandma Tala is the preferable card in Ruby Amethyst and even Amber Steel matches, while in Amber Emerald and Ruby Sapphire matches Flaversham/ How Far I'll go are better as turn three play. Especially in Ruby Amethyst matches turn three may as well be prefered to play a Brawl on opposing Flynn to deny the lore gain. Same in Ruby Sapphire to counter opposing Flavershams if you're on the draw.

Brawl is very matchup dependent. It's a good card into Ruby Amethyst if they're on Flynn and Sisu, Emerald Steel for early Diablos as well as in Amber Emerald for early Diablos. Amber Steel is dependent on their start, but if they open with Daisy into Piglet, then turn three Brawl the Piglet is needed for stabilize a little and deny the large lore advantage. As already stated into Ruby Sapphire Brawl is important on the draw to have an early answer into opposing Flavershams.

Maui is a good card to keep in the blind mulligan. Especially into Amber Steel and Ruby Amethyst Maui offers some good trades, while in the Ruby Sapphire match it's less important due to limited amount of targets.

Madame Medusa is a card which is of little use in the Ruby Sapphire matchup but can be a target for aggressive ramp strategies to be unexpected removal on turn four. For this you need ramp on turn 2 and turn 3 to be able to play a six ink cost card on turn 4 - however this empties your hand nearly completely. If you go this way in a Ruby Amethyst game, you can banish an opposing Sisu as you have nearly no cards left in hand, so that Sisu's strength would be three or less.

If your hand before mulligan contains a ramp option and Flaversham, then any random item can be kept, even if it's not a Popsticle, as the chance for not finding another item would be too high.

Powerplay could be playing Tamatoa on turn 5 if you're on the play - this however means you usually have no cards then left in your hand anymore. This strategy is adviseable against Ruby Sapphire to create an early threat which usually cannot be answered properly, against Ruby Amethyst as well to threat high lore gain before they can run Be Prepared - but is vulnerable against Be King Undisputed. The play is powerful against Sapphire Steel and Amber Steel too as this empties your hand to prevent the opponent more value from A Whole new World. If the opponent plays Emerald in his colors this would not be adviseable as most of them run You're Welcome and this throws you then back quite a bit - as the quality of cards you get as result is usually not as high.
