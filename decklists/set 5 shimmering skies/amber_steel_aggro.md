## Description

The set 5 amber steel aggro list gains some important new cards with Daisy and Pete. Especially Pete allows the build up of a wide board and protect it from any action/ song based interaction of the opponent. Card draw is added by Rapunzel and Doc. Dreamline is to have Simba in the Pride Lands and by this reduce character costs by one - combined with Stitch to draw cards and Phil to gain lore while playing out those cards. The ink curve is low with 16 one drops and 16 two drops to make use of the Stich capability as best as possible.
