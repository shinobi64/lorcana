## Description

The set 5 emerald steel deck attempts to make use of the combination between Megara and Hercules. Megara is a card added with set 4 and allows to quest multiple times if Hercules cards are played in the same turn. In addition the card draw is controlled by Diablo and Whole new World. In contrast to the discard variant this deck does not focus on discard but rather on a midrange strategy putting our each turn valuable cards and by this winning the game. Still best opening is Diablo into Cove, Shift Diablo to build up early pressure. Ursula Deceiver is the emerald all star and is a must inclusion in the deck.
