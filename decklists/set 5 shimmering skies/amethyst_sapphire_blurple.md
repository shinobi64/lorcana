## Description

The set 5 amethyst sapphire deck is focused on a midrange build and it's centered around the Mufasa card - as this allows using ink multiple times. The idea is to ramp up allowing the expensive cards to come in earlier as normal. Closing the game usually happens with the big questers like Ursula and Mufasa. Board control is established with Let it Go in addition with Elsa and Fox.
