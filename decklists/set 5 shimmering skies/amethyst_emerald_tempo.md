## Description

The set 5 amethyst emerald deck is not a fast aggro deck anymore. It's more tailored towards a midrange build with possible answers to questions the opponents can make. Tempo play is still there with Mother Gothel, Genie and Kit. Clarabelle allows replenishment of our hand in addition to the other card draw effects from the rabbits. Elsa is a powerful card to deal with evasises and excert characters which may pose a threat. Lyle allows for tempo play due to his reckless effect and is in the mid and late game an important utility to control the opponents lore count.
