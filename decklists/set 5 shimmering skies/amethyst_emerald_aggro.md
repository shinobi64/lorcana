## Description

The set 5 amethyst emerald aggro deck is a classic run deck which allows turning cards sideways. A huge number of one drops allows usually playing multiple characters each turn to ask questions which the opponent needs to answer. Tempo control is including using you're welcome and the discard effects from Merfolk. Card draw is managed using Diablo or the chromicon, Belle's library and queen's castle act as card draw engines too. Gathering knowledge and wisdom combined with the goats give the deck the reach for the 20 lore finish line
