## Description

The set 5 ruby steel decks is build around kights and dealing damage. All the new seven dwarfs are actually knights and the new snow white benefits from other knights being in play. The seven dwarfs mine has some nice benefits from moving knights there too - this can be used especially good in combination with Tuk Tuk. The deck is further rounded off using Hooks and Smees - especially the larger Hook card allows for recycling of Fire the Cannons. Card draw is a bit of an issue in this deck, but Beasts Mirror can help as the ability of the new Doc card.
