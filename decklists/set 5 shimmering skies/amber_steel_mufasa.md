## Description

The set 5 amber steel Mufasa (aka Steelfasa) list got the same kind of additions as other steel and amber based decks with Daisy for early pressure and Pete for action control. In addition the new legendary Jafar is added to control who can challenge and have a big challenger in turn on board. There is no Chernabog included as Chernabog and Perdita are kind of excluding each other due to their effects. Typical ink cheats with Doc and Gaston are included and Rapunzels tower for some more willpower.
