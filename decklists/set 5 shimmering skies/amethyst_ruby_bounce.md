## Description

The set 5 amethyst ruby bounce control (abbreviated often as R/A) is mostly consistent with the previous set, as the core of the deck is still based around the bounce package originating in set 2 combined with Flynn/ Sisu from set 4.

The deck can switch between aggresive questing and more control like behavior. Tools like Brawl and Be Prepared help to control the board state generally. Additional spot removal is given with the ladies in chairs. Big Sisu is currently included to allow for another method of board wipe, especially against aggressive decks.

The new library location can be combined with cards which anyhow want to leave the field, e.g. Chernabogs, Magic Broom or Rabbit - giving you there an additional card draw.
