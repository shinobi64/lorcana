## Description

Set 5 ruby sapphire is build to deal with the evolved meta of a mixture of control and discard decks. Aggro decks are no longer as popular as they have been at the beginning of the set, so consistency matters more than being able to deal with early threats. Especially for the mirror match the inclusion of four Maleficent - Monstrous Dragon are very rewarding. The item/ location destruction action Hide Away is very good in the mirror match or in Ruby Amethyst matches to deal with the Queens Castle. It's still important to ramp on turn two while being on the draw, on the play a setup with Chicha and then Tipo to additionally draw a card may be fast enough.
