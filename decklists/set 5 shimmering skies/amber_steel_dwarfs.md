## Description

This deck is a theme deck around Snow White and the seven dwarfs. It utilizes cards from set 2 and from set 5, while there are more dwarfs from set 5 included due to the synergy of the knights. Cinderella is added in as base variant and as shift, as it fits the knights synergy as well. Especially the mine works well together with the knights too. Little Snow White and Doc are there to cheat out the other dwarfs cheaper so you can play more of them in one turn. Minor control options are included as songs, especially bare necessities against heavier control decks.
