### Round 1

Round one paring was with Manuel and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. This is still a hard matchup due to the massive card draw which the deck can generate.

#### Game 1

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Alex and his Amethyst Emerald tempo deck. As his deck contains a lot of evasives it's very hard to handle and in both games he was too quick to finish.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  |                     |     |
| Alex (Randalex89) |      | 1/3/5/9/11/15/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/3/5/9              |     |
| Alex (Randalex89) |      | 1/4/7/14/17/15/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Bye, bye in round three.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

Final result of 1-2-0 was pretty bad - but kind of expected with the given deck choice and the meta game.who knows.
