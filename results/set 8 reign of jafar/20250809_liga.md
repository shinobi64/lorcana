## Casual Rounds

### Match 1

Between the rounds I played one game against Günther, as we had some time left in our round. I opted then to use the Amber Steel aggro deck, while Günther used his Amber Sapphire aggro deck - while it has as well some more late game options available.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 2/4/5/7/10/12/15/20 | (x) |

| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/8                     |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Luisa and her Amber Amethyst Madrigal song based deck. This deck is interesting due to some synergies - which however take some time to setup - which let's me enough time to develop my board and hand.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/5/7/8/9/10/13/15/17/20 | (x) |
| Luisa (Luisa) |      | 1/2/3                    |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 3/4/7/8/10/11/14/17/20 | (x) |
| Luisa (Luisa) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/4/9/7/5    |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three pairing was then with Alex and his Amethyst Emerald discard deck, which got inspired by my own deck which I used for the set championship in the Card Club. As this interrupts my hand early it's a very good counter deck into mine.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/3/5/7            |     |
| Alex (Randalex89) |      | 1/2/4/7/5/10/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/3/4/7/8/10/11 |     |
| Alex (Randalex89) |      | 1/2/3/5/9/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Final round was with Florian and his Amber Steel aggro deck build. I was a bit afraid of that one, as typically aggressive decks give me a hard time, but in both games I got my pieces into the hand and especially had the pirates life song handy available for controlling the lore totals.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount                    | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | --- |
| Me                  | (x)  | 2/5/7/9/10/13/15/16/17/19/20 | (x) |
| Florian (i2Ioulaki) |      | 2/4/7/12/10/13               |     |

#### Game 2

| Player              | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                  |      | 2/3/4/5/7/8/9/12/20 | (x) |
| Florian (i2Ioulaki) | (x)  | 2/4/11/13/11/12/10  |     |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Result

Final result with 3-1-0 was good, the match I lost had no real options in play. Unfortunately Matthias overtook me due to a better opponent score in the end.
