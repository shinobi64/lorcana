# Card Club Hockenheim - Reign of Jafar Release Event

This time not the typical midnight release event due to the public holiday on May 29th. So we had to move it to regular release day Friday May 30th into the evening. With 20 attendees nearly the maximum slots have been used. I was especially happy that we attended as full family. Melee details on https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/304701

## Tournament Rounds

As we sat together as a family on a table we could distribute a full display amongst ourselves - the display itself was a bit underwhelming but I could get some good top end cards with good stats and questing power. The pools for Anni, Fiona and Greta were as well quite good.

### Round 1

Round one was directly against Greta - she was quite happy to play with a familar face. I could get game one going for me and she was nearly able to snatch game two from me. She was quite happy the way she played and could accept the loss.

### Round 2

Round two was against Manuel - as always a strong opponent - and he had as well opened a very good pool. Especially the new item Hamster Ball was put to good use. In addition he had pulled the legendary Raya for some readying up other characters again. We went to time in the third game and had to draw finally as none of us could close it within the extra turns.

Result after round 2: **1-0-1**

### Round 3

Round three paired me into Nico, he has not played since a longer time but was tempted by the new cards. He put a good deck together as well - but more focused on early aggression which gave him a lead, but was then not able to counter the bigger statted characters from my end in the mid to late game.

Result after round 3: **2-0-1**

### Result

With 2-0-1 I was achieving a good 3rd place - which given the pool and the matchups was a a great result. Tournament was won by Phillip who was able to get to a 3-0-0 run.
Anni managed to get for a 2-1-0 run which secured her 10th place. Fiona managed to get to a 1-2-0 result with place 17 and Greta unfortunately lost all her games but managed to get on place 19 before Patrick who finished last.
