This time no time for casual rounds due to late work meetings.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Bulut and his Amethyst Emerald discard oriented list. He was rather new to the game and due to this he needed a lot of time to make his turns, so we ended up in overtime after just two games and had a draw.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/5/9/11/15/20   | (x) |
| Bulut (Bulut) | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/7/8/9/11 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/3/6/7                |     |
| Bulut (Bulut) | (x)  | 2/3/4/5/11/12/13/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-0-1**

### Round 2

Final round was with Felix and his more classic Ruby Amethyst Evasive list. This is a matchup where the dice roll decides who wins - and so it was as well here.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me             |      |                      |     |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/8/11/12/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 4/8/15/16/17/20 | (x) |
| Felix (Varolz) |      | 1/2/4           |     |

#### Game 3

| Player         | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 3/4                    |     |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 1/3/5/8/10/11/13/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-1-1**

### Round 3

Bye, bye in round three.

Result after round 3: **1-1-1**

### Result

Final result of 1-1-1 was pretty bad. Especially against the Amethyst Emerald deck I should have won the game - then it may have ended up differently - but who knows.
