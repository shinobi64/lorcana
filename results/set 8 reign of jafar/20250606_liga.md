# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga

First liga event in set 8 meta - we decided to go for a draft format to obtain some more new cards from the current set. Melee can be found on https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/320666. We have been 10 players - which allowed for one large draft pod.

## Casual Rounds

There was not much time for casual play before the draft, still I was able to play three games

### Round 1

I played against Kira, who did not had any decks available by herself, so I opted to lend her some decks from my side. The first matchup was between my running Emerald Ruby actions agains the Ruby Sapphire Items build.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/4/7/9/14/16/20 | (x) |
| Kira (RoXion) |      | 0                |     |

### Round 2

Second round was then Kira taking up the Amber Amethyst deck including the Monstro and Donald Duck combination setup which allows for a 20 lore gain in a single turn.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | --- |

| Kira (RoXion) | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/7/5/6/7            |     |

### Round 3

Last casual round was against Günter and his Emerald Sapphire deck which is build around floodborns.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Günter. I was able to get my bigger threats in play before Günter could bring his out.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 1/2/3/4/8/15/14/20    | (x) |
| Günter (GnF) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/8/13/16/17/18 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player       | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 1/2/3/4/9/15/20 | (x) |
| Günter (GnF) | (x)  | 1/3/5/8/10      |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Chris, he was able to draft more removal cards and as well had even more top end cards in his draft selection. So in both games he could out value me by these choices.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 1/2/3             |     |
| Chris (ChrC56) |      | 1/3/8/12/15/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 2/3/7         |     |
| Chris (ChrC56) |      | 1/3/4/7/13/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Kira. She drafted the legendary Raya and the new legendary Mickey Mouse. The Raya did an immense amount of work and in the second game Mickey was on the field as well - and in limited formats he's a menace.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 3/4/6/7/8/9/10        |     |
| Kira (RoXion) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/9/10/12/15/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 2/3/4/5/7          |     |
| Kira (RoXion) |      | 1/3/4/6/8/10/14/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

While drafting I had a much better feeling than what the deck actually delivered througout the rounds. Still the 1-2-0 result was ok.
