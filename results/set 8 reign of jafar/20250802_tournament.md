### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Johannes from Heidelberg with his aggressive Amber Steel deck build. Against this deck the matchup is very tricky and hard as they curve out so fast there is nearly no time for stabilization/ recovery. I was lucky to get started and by this won the first game, but was then stomped on the draw in game two. Game three was pretty close, but I could not find the final removal piece once he reached 18 lore.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Martin, who is local to Heidelberg as well. He was on an Emerald Sapphire deck using Clarabelle and then Bend To My Will to attack the hand. It worked out in the second game where he could ramp up fast and by this hit me. In both other games I was playing aggressively and could win by lore earlier than my hand was hurting me too much.

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Lucy with her deck in Amethyst Steel which has a lot of evasives included, especially a Tinkerbell shift line. While I could control the first game, I lost in game two to Pete locks and Goats and in game three the same way, as I could not find the last lore despite digging through more than 10 cards in my last turn.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Annika and her signature Amber Steel songs deck. Again I lost the dice roll which set me up in a hard spot. She managed in the first game to hit the curve with Whole New World pretty well, so she could establish the board and control it from there. In the second game it was the other way round and in the last game I drew all my four Be Prepared in the first turns just to see them wheeled away.

Result after round 4: **1-3-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Leonardo, who was running under playername Seretim (usually someone else) with a deck consisting of Amber and Emerald cards which quest for two or more. As he won the dice roll, I got stomped in games one and three. Especially in the last one he opened with Daisy into Merfolk and Daisy, into double Merfolk followed by Donald Bodyguard - a curve which is not beatable by my deck at all. In second game I could establish some board and use the shark with Pirates Life cycle to bring me back into control.

Result after round 5: **1-4-0**

### Result

Not the showing I imagined for my deck - especially in a rather receptive meta. Pairings have been horrible and dice roll results too - starting especially against aggressive questing decks on the draw was an uphill battle the whole day.
