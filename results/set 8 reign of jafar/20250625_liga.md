## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play my updated Ruby Sapphire Control list, as Andre asked for power based matchups. Otherwise I'd have resorted to playing another deck.

### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Romwald, he was running the Amber Steel aggro deck and was on the play. In the first game I got stuck with too many uninkable cards in my starting hand. Second game was a good win, and in the last game it was very close, I was missing out on one removal - even more literally only one available ink.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Andre. He was originally playing the Ruby Sapphire items list, but switched then over to the midrange variant to give it a try. We battled hard in both games and could not go to a third one, as we have reached the time limit of the round.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount                         | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------------------------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 1/2/0/1/3/5/7/9/11/13/14/16/18/20 | (x) |
| Andre (nastra) |      | 1/3/4/7/8/10/13/11                |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount                             | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 2/5/6/9/7                             |     |
| Andre (nastra) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/8/9/11/9/11/12/13/16/17/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-1-1**

### Result

1-1-1 - was quite a good result. I was expecting the Ruby Sapphire games to be grindy, however my best take away was that this deck can take on aggro - as the loss was rather close.
