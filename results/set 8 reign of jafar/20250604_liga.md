# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga

First liga event in the new set 8 meta for the Wizards Well. As usual then the format was draft to get to know the cards better and improve the individual collection. Melee link https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/319194. Six players showed up, which made a good draft pod with the typical chatting during draft.

## Casual Rounds

Before and during the tournament some constructed play took place to prepare for the upcomming bigger tournaments.

### Match 1

First match was with Manuel and his Emerald Steel discard deck, which was seen as one of the best meta decks. I opted to go for a Ruby Sapphire items deck, which should have own reliable card draw to get around the discard line.

| Patrick (Marzipan87) | (x)  | 1/3/5/11/16 |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 - a good result and a lot of fun to draft the new set. It feels in general a bit slower which allows to play higher in curve.
