## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play again the Emerald Ruby Actions list which served me well in the recent weeks. It's a fun deck to play with a lot of control elements but still different than my classic Ruby Sapphire control lists.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Felix, who was running an Amber Emerald discard list. So we had kind of a discard against discard match - in which no player would really have cards in hand. In the first game Felix could establish the better line, while in the second and third game my ruby cards were the deciding ones.

#### Game 1

| -------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me             |      | 2                  |     |

| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4                 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Matthias and his Amber Steel songs list which is not using Whole New World anymore but instead Surfer Stitch and Look at my Family song to refill the hand. In both games I was not able to find my 5 cost removal songs/ actions so I could not deal efficiently with the bigger characters on his side. On the flip side he got some good draws with the Grab Your Sword - which effectively removed my board.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/2/3/5/6/8/11      |     |
| Matthias (Jurki) | (x)  | 2/3/6/9/12/14/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/7/9/10/11         |     |
| Matthias (Jurki) |      | 2/5/7/8/9/11/13/14/12/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Jens and his Emerald Ruby Queen of Hearts damage based deck. Against this deck it's important to clear out some key cards and then it's rather easy to win. I could do this in both games and then claim the victory.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/7/9/11/12/13/17/20 | (x) |
| Jens (Tratux) |      | 1/2/4/9/11/12              |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/3/5/6/8/11/13/15/17/20 | (x) |
| Jens (Tratux) | (x)  | 2/3/1                    |     |

Result after round 2: **2-1-0**

### Result

The 2-1-0 result yielded me a 5th place, as we had due to the three bye a rather condensed number of players with the 2-1-0 result. I was again very happy with my deck and how it was going. There may be one or the other card which can be swapped to make it more consistent. While the deck runs a rather high number of uninkables it was not feely bricky there.
