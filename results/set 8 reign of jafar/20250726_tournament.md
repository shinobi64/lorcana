## Tournament Rounds

I opted for the Amethyst Emerald discard deck, as the testing with the Amber Steel discard was not too positive. As well nearly everbody expected me to play Ruby Sapphire, so I could at least in the beginning have some advantage.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me Hannes from the FancyTreasure in Biblis and he fully went for the assumption of me playing Ruby Sapphire. His facial expression after I played my first card was priceless. It was the expected grindy matchup against the Amethyst Sapphire deck - which however set the tone again for the day.

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Fabian from Biblis with another Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. In that game I had a bad start into my first match and by this I lost the overall round very close to him.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Manuel and yet another Amethyst Sapphire deck. At this point I was getting a little bit salty, as the matchup is not the best and I did not wanted to grind each round to the maximum. Luckily it went in the last game into my direction and I could close out with my shift Ursula.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount          | Win |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Fabian from the BattleBear. He was running an Amethyst Emerald discard deck too - however in a different line up. And the games went as expected - who ever was able to spam out the most unanswered Diablos won. Unfortunately this was not me in the game three.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 1/8/12/13            |     |
| Fabian (Gonk1) |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6/10/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 1/3/6/9/11/18/20 | (x) |
| Fabian (Gonk1) |      | 0                |     |

#### Game 3

| Fabian (Gonk1) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/7/11/12/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Michael from the Fancy Treasure with his Ruby Sapphire midrange (Shark) deck. At this point it was win our out - I was the best places 2-2-0 player, so with a win, I'd have high chances to still reach the top cut. In the first game I thought I had it - but then Michael got good top deck after top deck and could turn it around - while in game two and three I took over control early, especially on his hand size and never let it slip again.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 1/2/4/9/14/15/13/11/17/15 |     |
| Michael (FancyMichi) |      | 1/4/7/10/13/14/15/18/20   | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player               | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 2/4/6/9/11/20 | (x) |
| Michael (FancyMichi) |      | 1/2/3/5/6/8   |     |

#### Game 3

| Player               | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me                   |      | 1/2/3/6/7/10/14/20 | (x) |
| Michael (FancyMichi) | (x)  | 1/3                |     |

Result after round 5: **3-2-0**

### Top 8

In the top eight round I faced Mark as well from the Fancy Treasure in Biblis. He was 5-0-0 after the swiss rounds with his Ruby Amethyst deck. Fortunately this is a matchup which is very much in my favor, as the build up is quite slow and gives me ample time to control the hand.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/5/9/15/20         | (x) |
| Mark (GameHunter) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/10/11 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 3/4/5/6/7/9/11/13/20 | (x) |
| Mark (GameHunter) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/6/8/9        |     |

Result after round 6: **4-2-0**

### Top 4

In the top four pairing I had to go against Alex with his Amethyst Emerald tempo deck. This was very unfavored from the start as his build is nearly completely around evasives, which makes it hard to handle. And he was able to pull in both games quickly away.

#### Game 1

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |

| Alexander (Randalex89) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/7/10/12/13/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                     | (x)  | 1/2/4/7/11     |     |
| Alexander (Randalex89) |      | 1/3/7/13/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 7: **4-3-0**

### Result

Goal achieved, promo card was won with a final 3rd place in a tough competition. I'm happy to have taken the Amethyst Emerald deck, as with the Ruby Sapphire deck I most probably would have not had such a good run, especially not against the Blurple matchups.

Inkdecks has all the decklists available - https://inkdecks.com/events/view/341200

Anni had a mixed run with a 2-3-0 result and making it to rank 19. She had played an Amber Sapphire aggro deck - which as well surprised some opponents. She could have gone 3-2-0 but made a mistake in the match against Michael.
