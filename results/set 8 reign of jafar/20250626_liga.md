# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga

A new week in the Card Club liga. This week again constructed and again using the Playhub. https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/155637. In total nine players showed up - so we had unfortunately always a bye assigned to a player.

## Casual Rounds

I only had the time to play one casual match before the actual event.

### Round 1

I opted for the Amber Steel songs list - which is a kind of default fallback for me. Matthias was on an Emerald Steel list which tried to use Hades and Mickey Mouse to bring out the new legendary Mickey, which is very hard to handle in general.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Phillip, wo was running a more traditional Ruby Amethyst deck with a lot of one drops, library and the rabbit bounce package. This is traditionally strong into Ruby Sapphire and it comes down to finding the Lucky Dime and the Tamatoa to overturn it. While I could find the Lucky Dime, the Tamatoas were not found - and by this I could not close the game before the inevitable Goat bounce closure by Phillip.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was Rene and his Emerald Sapphire Floodborns list - this has some interesting cards which combo off the floodborns and shifts - which can be very scary. However with the reset options in Ruby Sapphire I could get back the board control and then close out from there.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Chris and his Amethyst Steel aggro list. He included some more midrange cards which I was not expecting to see. In the fist game I was a bit stuck on a slow start, which allowed him to advance way too fast to catch up. In the second game this went better and I was able to obtain board control and as well keep the card advantage as minimal as possible.

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

With a final result 1-2-0 it was not fully what I expected bringing this deck. Still I made some playing errors from which I can learn, especially to grind down the Ruby Amethyst list.
