### Round 1

Round one paring was with Felix and his Amethyst Emerald tempo deck. He had some very good openings with the merfolks and some good follow ups with evasives. As my deck did not have a lot on evasive answers this was indeed a problem and let to a rather quick defeat.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me             |      | 2/3                |     |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 2/7/10/12/16/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Felix (Varolz) |      | 2/3/4/5/9/12/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was Anni and as well an Amethyst Emerald tempo list - as seen above in the meta share this was the most played deck in this week. Anni got off to a way weaker start, so I could press on and develop some puppies followed up by Cogsworth protection. This worked properly in game one and game two.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/2/4/8/11/20 | (x) |
| Anni (Ironlady94) |      | 1/2           |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/3/4/5/6/10/14/17/19/20 | (x) |
| Anni (Ironlady94) | (x)  | 1/2/3/6/9                |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Matthias and his non wheel Amber Steel songs list. This was a back and forth between exchanges on our characters. He made in the final game a mistake to not race me, which finally costs him the game.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 5/8/10    |     |

| Matthias (Jurki) |      | 1              |     |

#### Game 3

Result after round 2: **2-1-0**

### Result

Final result of 2-1-0 into a field that was not really receptive for my deck. I learned again a lot on this deck, but next week will then be again another deck - as it's usual for the weekly liga.
