# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga

Another constructed tournament in the Wizards Well - this week seven players have shown for playing. We used the playhub again - https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/162183. As this was the last event before the set championship there were more meta decks to be found.

## Casual Rounds

No time this week for casual play.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play my a version of Amber Steel Songs - which is one of the decks in consideration for upcomming set championships

- 4 Cinderella - Ballroom Sensation
- 4 Rhino - One-Sixteenth Wolf
- 4 The Troubadour - Musical Narrator
- 4 Mr. Smee - Bumbling Mate
- 4 Ariel - Spectacular Singer
- 4 Pete - Games Referee
- 4 Rapunzel - Gifted with Healing
- 4 Rhino - Power Hamster
- 3 Ariel - Sonic Warrior
- 1 Cinderella - Stouthearted
- 1 The Bare Necessities
- 4 Let the Storm Rage On
- 4 Strength of a Raging Fire
- 4 And Then Along Came Zeus
- 2 Doc - Bold Knight
- 4 Beast - Tragic Hero
- 2 Namaari - Single-Minded Rival
- 4 Be Our Guest

The main change is to not include the A Whole New World song - but instead have Doc, Beast and backup by the Be Our Guest song. With the number of songs included the additional Ariel Sonic Warrior can make a lot of use.

### Round 1

Round one bye is not the way to start - but it may happen.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired with Manuel and not his typical deck, but an Amethyst Sapphire Blurple instead. Usually this should be ok to deal with, but it worked out only in game one, while in both other games I was not able to find songs, to keep his evasive characters at bay.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Romwald and his Amber Steel aggro deck. He adjusted a few cards compared to last week, but the aggressive core of Amber cards paired with good questers in Steel and control cards in Steel remained.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/6/20    | (x) |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 1/6/11    |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 6/9/20                  | (x) |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 1/4/8/10/12/14/15/17/18 |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 was an ok result - it was enough for fourth place due to the tie breakers being influenced by the bye in the first round. I think there is one to two more songs needed in the deck to make a better hit ratio for Ariel - I had four out of five misses in Ariel.
