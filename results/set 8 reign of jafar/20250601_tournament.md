# Battle Bear Kaiserslautern - Reign of Jafar Release Constructed

As part of the release weekend for set 8 Reign of Jafar the Battle Bear hosted a constructed event to see which decks could be done by the new set.

## Tournament Rounds

Instead of going to my typical colors I opted to go to a rather untypical deck list with Emerald Ruby actions. List is https://dreamborn.ink/decks/cuVKF8CtJY1s3iKCH4Bi - the list tries to get the benefit of the new discard actions and control actions and then capitalize of Robin Hood and Maui Half Shark.

- 4 Undermine
- 3 Hypnotize
- 4 We Don't Talk About Bruno
- 3 Brawl
- 4 Sudden Chill
- 4 Robin Hood - Sharpshooter
- 4 Ursula - Deceiver
- 3 Maui - Half-Shark
- 4 Prince John - Greediest of All
- 2 Chip - Quick Thinker
- 4 Diablo - Devoted Herald
- 4 Diablo - Maleficent's Spy
- 2 Wrong Lever!
- 3 Dragon Fire
- 3 Maui - Hero to All
- 4 Sir Hiss - Aggravating Asp
- 4 Vanellope Von Schweetz - Spunky Speedster
- 2 A Pirate's Life
- 1 Lilo - Causing an Uproar

I'd have played more of the new Lilo cards but I was not able to find any others from the displays we opened so far.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me Dominik from the larger Kaiserslautern community - he was playing on an Emerald Ruby Queen of Hearts damage based deck. Once you know this deck you know which pieces need to be countered hard time - here the Brawls did realy helped getting the control state established.

#### Game 1

| Dominik (Trinroy) |      | 1/2/3/5/6/2                     |     |

#### Game 2

| Dominik (Trinroy) | (x)  | 1/3/6/7/8/9/10/8/9       |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Manuel and his trusty Sapphire Steel midrange deck. He added in the Bianca from set 7 and from set 8 Namaari and Arthur. He got in both games the kind of perfect cards in hand to deal with my board so he could establish advantage which I could not come back from.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2/3/5               |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 3/8/13/15/17/15/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 2                |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 2/3/5/9/13/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Julian or better known as Artabax. He played his signature deck with Amethyst Emerald - however in a more aggressive version. In the first game I could get the state early on under control, while in the second and third game it was more a back and forth. I was unlucky in game three with my Robin Hood action finders - which did not hit on any removal action. Due to this Julian could place lorethal in play and I had no remaining outs. I would have won the next turn as well - but I could not by myself enough time at the end. Overall a great round of play.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 1/3/4/8/9/10/20 | (x) |
| Julian (TSR_Artabax) |      | 1/2/3/5/6/8/10  |     |

| Julian (TSR_Artabax) |      | 2/3/5/6/7/8/10/12/13/14/15/13/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me into Sascha, against whom I played as well in the past in Kaiserslautern. He was running an Emerald Steel midrange deck which was focusing on using Chief Bogo and then bringing in floodborn characters. The deck seems to fail on good reliable card draw, so I could use my discard actions very efficiently - and by removing the Bogo's on time I did not made myself vulnerable against the floodborn shifts.

#### Game 1

| Player                      | Play | Lorecount               | Win |

| Sascha (BBB_Jiminy_Cricket) |      | 1/2                     |     |

#### Game 2

| Player                      | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |

| Sascha (BBB_Jiminy_Cricket) | (x)  | 2/3                 |     |

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Andi, with whom I travelled to the tournament - and as I lended him some cards, I knew he was playing an Amber Steel songs variant using Beyond the Horizon and the Dino shift line. I could discard him in two games, while in the other game he could establish the Beyond the Horizon early on which made it a match winner.

#### Game 1

| Andi (Andi1066) | (x)  | 2/4/8/10            |     |

Result after round 5: **3-2-0**

### Round 6

Round 6 was against Daniel, who is one of the owners from the Battle Bear store. He was playing a Ruby Sapphire action based deck, which included the new legendary Lilo as she synergizes well with the actions which are anyhow played in that deck. He got some good top decks in the first game, especially the Sisu to clear my whole board. In the second game it was a nail biter, which I won by brawling my own two Robin Hoods - which gave me the needed lore boost from the Maui Half Shark. In the last game he over extended initially by putting both Lilo's out early after playing three one cost actions. Due to this I could discard him into top deck mode with very little available ink.

| Daniel (TenshiDX) | (x)  | 2/4/6/4/6              |     |

Result after round 6: **4-2-0**

### Result

It has been a good comeback after the 1-2-0 start - however as I came from behind and nearly all of my opponents had worse scores I ended up outside of the top eight cut in the end. Still with nearly 40 players present a place 14 with a good score was quite a good achievment.
