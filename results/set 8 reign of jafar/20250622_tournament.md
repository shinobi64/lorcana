# deKolonisten - Lowlands Lore Quest 1

One of the biggest events in the set 8 Reign of Jafar meta was organized by a Belgium community. It took part on Turnhout and nearly 256 players participating. There was a very good pricing support which created the high attendence rate combined with a very high skilled player base. Tournament was still run in melee - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/328067#

## Tournament Rounds

After a lot of testing I thought the Ruby Sapphire midrange list would still fare good into the current meta, which is very diverse. Yes there would have been some "automatic" losses, but with the wide meta I expected a higher match variety which should serve me well.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me Julian from the french professional team Be Prepared. He was running their signature Amethyst Emerald Discard deck. In both games he got kind of the godhand start and as well some good follow ups, so I could really see no chance to counter the starts. We debated after the match as well a bit, and he saw as well no direct misplays which would have avoided the result.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Bernd and his Ruby Amethyst deck. There was still the bounce mechanic included but as well some evasives. I could in both games bring my shark early online and ensure that he was not drawing too many cards. Then the manors took over for the final lore gain.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Sebastian with his Emerald Steel Discard deck. In the first game I got very lucky with my cards and he had a slow start, so I could establish my resoures and board without giving him a way back. In the second game it was a complete mirror to that and he got running with his game plan.

Result after round 3: **1-1-1**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me into Dennis from the team Olaf. He was running a Ruby Sapphire items list. In both games I could get the tempo advantage on my side and could close out with the manor play. In the second game, the finishing via two Super Goofs was my luck to get the missing four lore points in.

Result after round 4: **2-1-1**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Jonny - he was running a very interesting Emerald Sapphire item list powered by Oswald. This is a very high rolly deck, but with great rewards - especially against control decks. In both matches I could not find the removal options in time to stop the Oswald triggers.

Result after round 5: **2-2-1**

### Round 6

Round 6 was against Jelle and an Amethyst Steel aggressive build around magic brooms and Yen Sid. This build has gotten more popular since it won a large event in the US two weeks ago. In the first game I could not stop the aggression early enough, so he could finish with the Goat bounce, however in the second game I could put enough pressure on to close the game in my favor.

Result after round 6: **2-2-2**

### Round 7

Round 7 pairing was inot Nico from a french player team. He was running a more traditional Ruby Amethyst bounce list, which ran me over in the first game with the value of the library. I made there a mistake to not remove the library in time as I was at that point more playing for the characters on board. In the second game I pressured with finally three manors and a pirates life for the win.

#### Game 1

Result after round 7: **2-2-3**

### Round 8

Round 8 pairing was in Burjan and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple list. This is traditionally a hard matchup, as there are a lot of removal options on that deck combined with a lot of card draw.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 3/4/5/6          |     |
| Burjan (TU_Degerino) |      | 1/4/2/4/10/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player               | Play | Lorecount                             | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 2/4/5/6/8/10                          |     |
| Burjan (TU_Degerino) |      | 1/3/6/4/9/7/9/11/13/17/15/19/17/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 8: **2-3-3**

### Result

Tough to rate the result. On paper a 2-3-3 run is not very impressive - however with a very diverse meta it still felt good to have a comfortable deck available with a good matchup spread. There have been mistakes made in games 6 and 7 - while game 1 and 5 were always unwinable with the given cards drawn. I as well have to acknowledge that the player field was very strong and highly skilled - there had been no easy/ avoidable mistakes.
