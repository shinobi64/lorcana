### Match 2

This was just a quick match with Noel in between rounds using my Ruby Sapphire items list against his Ruby Amethyst burn deck. This is not really favored as the Ruby Amethyst deck goes there way to fast and has the instant lore.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                       | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------------- | --- |

| Noel (Apfel7) | (x)  | 1/3/6/9/10/12/14/15/16/17/18/20 | (x) |

### Match 3

In the second match I used my Ruby Sapphire Aggro deck in match against Noel's Amber Sapphire aggro deck. I could utilize my high strength characters there to gain lore and as well challenge pretty good into the characters on his side.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 3/6/8/11/13/19/20 | (x) |
| Noel (Apfel7) |      | 1/2/5/9           |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 3/6/8/11/16/18/20 | (x) |
| Noel (Apfel7) | (x)  | 1/3/6/11/13/14/17 |     |

#### Match 4

In the last casual match I opted for my Yen Sid brooms deck against Noel's Amber Sapphire deck. A pretty good choice as there a lot of lore gain and card draw on my side - as well good challenging potential.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 3/4/5/6/7/16/17/20     | (x) |
| Noel (Apfel7) |      | 1/2/3/5/6/8/9/11/15/17 |     |

### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Romwald and the Ruby Sapphire Midrange deck. I got on both games a pretty good start - but he got the best top decks in a row possible and by this could flip over the games.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/6/8/6       |     |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 4/6/10/14/16/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 2/3/10/12/13   |     |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) |      | 2/4/6/11/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired with Noel and his Ruby Amethyst Burn deck. In both games I was able to discard him his hand and develop my own pieces to then gain advantage in the lore race.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/3/2/5/4/8/12/17/20 | (x) |
| Noel (Apfel7) |      | 3/4/6/7/8/9/11/12/13 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 2/3/6/5/8/15/20           | (x) |
| Noel (Apfel7) | (x)  | 3/4/5/8/10/11/12/13/14/15 |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Manuel and his Amber Steel Aggro deck. This were difficult matchups and we took some time to complete all three games. In the end I was able to pressure too much, especially with the Sonic Warrior Ariel.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 2/4/6/12/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (Darksteel) |      | 1/2/3/4/5   |     |

#### Game 2

| Player             | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 2/4/6                |     |
| Manuel (Darksteel) | (x)  | 2/5/4/10/12/15/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | -------------------------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 2/4/7/10/12/14/17/18/19/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (Darksteel) |      | 1/3/4/5/6/8/10/11/13       |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 was an ok result - worth second place due to the worse tie breaker compared to Romwald, who took the win. Manuel was back on place three due to the loss in the last round.
