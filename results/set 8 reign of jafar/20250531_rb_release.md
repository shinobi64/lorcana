# Ravensburger Store Mannheim - Reign of Jafar Release Event

The Ravensburger Store in Mannheim did a PreRelease event for the start of set 8 Reign of Jafar as well. With a Convention Playmat from 2024 on the line as top price it was quite a good event to participate in. Anni was very hyped on getting the mat, so we both attended the event.

Overall organization was a bit strange, as you could purchase more boosters than just the six needed for the sealed pool - however there was no reminder to only use six packs for building the deck. As well the handling of draws was strange - as even in the swiss phase the higher lore count should be taken as decider - which is contrary to the official tournament rules section 3.4

"Swiss rounds: If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five, award match points as described in 3.3 to any player who has won at least one game. If neither player has won any gamein the match at the end of turn five, the game is a draw"

In addition a top cut was announced but this should not follow the regular top cut bracket structure - we clarified this in the end - however the draw handling lead to some scrambled results.

## Tournament Rounds

I had an interesting pool from my boosters with not so much top end as I'd like to have and a limited amount of card draw and evasives it was a challenging setup to go into a sealed tournament.

### Round 1

Round one was pairing with Miguel - a good young player with some good instinct for play lines. He was able to get a legendary Bambi from his pool which was a trouble maker due to it's recurring lore gain from entering the game. I could however get the board control setup during mid to late game.

#### Game 1

| ---------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/3/4/6/7/10/11/13/20   | (x) |
| Miguel (MdR0300) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/6/9/10/11/12/13 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |

| Miguel (MdR0300) | (x)  | 1/4/7/11/14                 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was against Tanja, a player who started just a few weeks back - and she assembled a good pool, but was not yet so good with deciding, by when to quest and when to challenge.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 2/1/4/7/13/20 | (x) |
| Tanja (dearlein) | (x)  | 2/5/6/9       |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/2/3/8/16/20 | (x) |
| Tanja (dearlein) | (x)  | 2/4           |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three paired me into Marco, who was sitting next to me during the deck building phase. In the two games I could develop the Hamster Ball item and the Dino and by this force very good trades for me. Marco build his deck more around the 1 drop Lady which then enables a lot of value if you can drop more 1 drops. Due to this he was lacking some challenging power on the board.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/3/9/17/20 | (x) |
| Marco (Nurephel) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5     |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/2/5/8/16/20 | (x) |
| Marco (Nurephel) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/6/8/9 |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Round 4

With being 3-0-0 I was secured for the top cut. As this time the last game was mixing things up because there a draw was given. I was paired into Romwald - he got a good pool with the new Tramp and as well Hades - means card draw forever. We went into overtime and naturally it would have been a draw, but according to the strange rules the win was given to Romwald - so I was 3rd after swiss phase - by regular scoring I'd have been first.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |

#### Game 3

| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 1/4/5/6/8/9/11/13/15/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **3-1-0**

### Top 4

We finally setup the proper top cut structure I was paired with Romwald again, as he was second and I got to third position. Due to his better ranking he could get the first game started. I managed to get that first game won on the draw which was huge. Second game the Tramp drew him near endless cards, but I could turn it around in the game 3 - while Romwald was a bit ink screwed.

Result after round 4: **4-1-0**

### Top 2

Santiago had to leave early so he could not get the finals played - which secured me the precious play mat.

### Result

Won the play mat - had a good time with Anni, as well as with Andi and Marco - it was a good event. Melee was not updated for the finals so no final result table available.
