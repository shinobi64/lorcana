## Tournament Rounds

### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Matthias. The Raya I got in the draft made the difference due to the double quest ability and the additional lore gained that way.

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Patrick - he was having a good draft list with evasives. In the second and third game I could conter the evasives properly so that he could not run away with the game like in game 1.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                   |      | 1/3            |     |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) | (x)  | 1/3/7/11/13/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player               | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 1/3/2/5/10/13/18/17/20 | (x) |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) |      | 1/3/4/8/9              |     |

#### Game 3

| Player               | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                   |      | 1/0/3/5/10/16/15/20 | (x) |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4             |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Result

3-0-0 - best result possible for three rounds played. We had a very good opening rate of legendary cards and despite the heat some fun with the draft. RPH can still use a lot of improvements.
