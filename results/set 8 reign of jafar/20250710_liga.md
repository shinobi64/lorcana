## Casual Rounds

If I'd have known how my casual rounds would go - I'd not have played them at all. I played all two rounds with Manuel and his Sapphire Steel midrange deck and felt hopeless in nearly each game.

### Match 1

I opted to play the Ruby Sapphire control list as this should be able to go over the top of the Sapphire Steel midrange list. However Manuel kept the good cards and drew even better - with feeling for me that he had always the perfect cards to answer my approaches.

### Match 2

I opted to switch over to the Emerald Ruby actions list which is naturally a bit weaker against steel cards but with the discard options it should have a chance to go against it. But same procedure as in the other matches - nearly perfect cards from top in each match. Especially twice playing Ursuala - seeing no songs just to get them pulled as top decks in the next turn.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play the Ruby Sapphire control deck list - just to show that already - it's not a list I intend to play during set championships.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Phillip and his typical Ruby Amethyst evasive list. Game one was rather even with a good end on his side, while I could get it more aggressive going in game two. In the last game I got literally no card draw cards and ran then out of options fast - while Phillip opened with three one drops followed by library - the perfect hand against Ruby Sapphire especially in the early game.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Lucy and an Amethyst Steel deck which was build around Jafar and the illusion characters. These synergise quite good, but I could bring in my removals in time and then quest out aggressively, especially as there was no response found for the Maui half shark.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Jan and his Amber Emerald Chernadog list. He won the dice roll which made this a steep uphill battle for me. In the first game Jan was going great but missed all card draw options and then run out of options. Second game he got all he needed, especially the new shift Trump which draws cards for each banished character. Last game was really close, as Jan was again deploying a good amount of threats, but I could gain enough resources then to deploy Sisu and whipe the board. Jan was so confident I'd have Be Prepared so he slammed down his Ursula when I closed my 6 ink turn - just to be disappointed by the sight of Sisu. A pirates life came in clutch and then I could close the game with Lucky Dime on Sisu.

Result after round 2: **2-1-0**

### Result

Final result of 2-1-0 into a mixed field. I still despise that I had to go twice on the draw against more unfavored matchups but in general the deck felt stable again, but a bit too weak for really quick questing decks on the oppsing side.
