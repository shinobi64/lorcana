### Round 1

Round one paring was with Phillip and the Ruby Sapphire midrange list. Game one was rather close as I could gain lore quickly but he stalled me finally and could take over. In the second game I started but could not get lore as quickly as in game one and then I could as well not win it anymore.

#### Game 1

| Player                | Play | Lorecount                       | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                    |      | 1/3/5/6/8/10/14/15/16/18/16     |     |
| Phillip (Swordinator) | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/7/8/9/12/13/14/16/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player                | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me                    | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/8/10/11/9 |     |
| Phillip (Swordinator) |      | 3/8/13/16/18/20   | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Bye, bye in round two.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round was with Felix and his more midrange oriented Amethyst Steel list. He could outvalue me with the rabbits and could clear quickly with the foxes and crabs. Especially with the number of low cost characters the strategy of gaining multiple times from Prince John was not successful.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me             |      | 3/5/8                    |     |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 1/3/4/5/9/10/11/13/15/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount                     | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 3/6/9/12                      |     |
| Felix (Varolz) |      | 1/2/4/6/7/8/10/12/13/14/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

Final result of 1-2-0 felt ok for a given more fun deck. I still follow up with the approach of running a different deck each week to not be too predictable for the set championships.
