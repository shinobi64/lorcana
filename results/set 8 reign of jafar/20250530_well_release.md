# Wizards Well - Reign of Jafar Release Event

As the weekend of the release was very crowded - due to this the PreRelease event was moved to Friday noon. With 10 players a rathe good attendence was there for the special time. Melee details can be found in https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/305372.

## Tournament Rounds

Sealed pool was quite ok, but lacking the evasive characters - and I was not able to have any legendary cards/ some of the good super rares. I had to rely on the good commons and uncommon cards.

### Round 1

Round one was against Andre, who had been able to pull three legendary cards which provided him with a lot of value - so there was no way to check this, especially not after loosing the dice roll.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me                  |      | 2/3                   |     |
| Andre (andrecruz19) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/9/11/14/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was against Anni, who had a bit a better pool than myself and she won the dice roll. So I tried to counter her aggression but then my own usage of Arthur screwed me due to the missing card draw.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 1/2/4/8/11/14/17    |     |
| Anni (ITFairy) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/10/12/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Round three paired me into Anni, who was as well split around the cards that she pulled. I lost the dice roll again, but could establish a good board state to take over control of the game.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/5/6/7/10/14/20 | (x) |
| Anni (Ironlady94) | (x)  | 1/4/8/10/12      |     |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round four paired me into Andre. He got the Dino shift cards in his pool and played them aggressively. I could counter them with a lot of effort and by this take over as he could not follow up with other threats.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 1/2/4/9/12/20 | (x) |
| Andre (nastra) |      | 2/5/6/9       |     |

Result after round 3: **2-2-0**

### Result

The opions on the new cards are kind of split - there are some good cards, but especially the legendaries feel a bit underwhelming. Pricing was quite nice with a big Lorcana promo item and the oversized cards being distributed to the top three players.
