## Tournament Rounds

### Round 1

First round was little Ole and his deck, he had focused a lot on one and two cost characters to bring early pressure to the board. I could in both games use the Grab your Bow card to clear out two cards at once and then quest by myself.

#### Game 1

| Player      | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ----------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me          | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Ole (MaOle) |      | 18        |     |

#### Game 2

| Player      | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ----------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me          |      | 20        | (x) |
| Ole (MaOle) | (x)  | 7         |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Manuel and his iteration of the draft deck. He had double Willow and Angel included in his list, but I could answer again in both games with the Grab Your Bow and the Chief from Pocahontas as big bodyguard. Thus allowed me in both games to quest for victory.

#### Game 1

| Player                  | Play | Lorecount          | Win |

| Manuel (TCR_Darksteel1) | (x)  | 4/6/10/12/13/15/17 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player                  | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                      |      | 1/2/3/8/10/12/14/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (TCR_Darksteel1) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/7           |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Johannes. He had a good setup of his deck too - ran as well the Willow card which came out in both games on curve. In addition he had matching actions to cleanly remove my oppressive card draw cards without much hassle. The new Isis Vanderchill helped there too. And then his larger characters where no viable options to trade with my smaller evasives.

#### Game 1

| Player                | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |

#### Game 2

| Player                | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me                    | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/7/10/15 |     |
| Johannes (Johnny3001) |      | 1/5/10/11/17/20   | (x) |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 a good result, had a lot of fun while drafting the pool and was rewarded with an enchanted card in on of the boosters too.
