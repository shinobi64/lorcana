## Tournament Rounds

### Round 1

First round pairing was with Manuel and his sealed pool - he seemed to have drawn a bit slower than my pool, while having some evasives.
I could race both games and clear his cards in between.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 5/7/10/18/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 1/2/4        |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount         | Win |

| Manuel (Hetti89) | (x)  | 2                 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Günter, who had a large number of evasives in his pool and started racing in both games where he was on the play. I could have turned the last game around but I used up my "Grab your bow" card one round too early.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 2/6                 |     |
| Günter (GnF) | (x)  | 2/4/5/7/10/12/16/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player       | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 2/9/15/20 | (x) |
| Günter (GnF) |      | 1/2/5/9   |     |

#### Game 3

| Player       | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 3/5/8/13/19                 |     |
| Günter (GnF) | (x)  | 1/3/4/7/8/12/13/15/16/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Max. He had some interesting cards in his pool, but I forced some bad trades for him with my characters and could utilize the Alice and Donald combination to my advantage.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 1/4/6/13/18/20 | (x) |
| Max (Cantyr) |      | 1/2/4/6/8      |     |

#### Game 2

| Player       | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 2/4/6/8/13/20 | (x) |
| Max (Cantyr) | (x)  | 2/5/8/11/13   |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 is a good result and reflected the good cards I had in the pool. It could have been a full win, but the playing mistake in hindsight costed me the game against Günter.
