## Tournament Rounds

### Round 1

First round was a bye - so I'd some chance to look around and see what cards are played. I saw a lot of legendaries and interesting items and new characters. No surprise evasive characters still ruled the boards.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Andre and his deck - he had a good pool with a lot of card draw and removal options combined with the Snow Fort item which he could bring out in both games early. This bundled up with large evasive bodies was too much to handle.

#### Game 1

| Player      | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| ----------- | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me          |      | 1/2/4/3/2                   |     |
| Andre (AMS) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/8/9/10/14/15/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player      | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |
| ----------- | ---- | -------------------------- | --- |
| Me          | (x)  | 1/0/2/4/6/7/9              |     |
| Andre (AMS) |      | 1/2/3/7/8/9/10/12/13/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Christian. He had as well some interesting cards in his deck - in the first game we had this typical stalemate situation where I could get too late to the needed force on board. In the second game I simply ran away with the game. In the last game it was a back and forth - but deciding play was his Timon in the turn before I could play the Grab Your Bow. That would have been essential to remove all his evasives from the board.

| Christian (ChrC56) | (x)  | 2/4/10/16/20 |     |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round four pairing was with Günter. He had some interesting cards in his deck as well, e.g. the new boost Genie. However in both games I could establish a better board state and then could close with questing of Pocahontas.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 1/3/5/8/10/20 | (x) |
| Günter (GnF) | (x)  | 5/6/8/11/16   |     |

#### Game 2

| Player       | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me           |      | 2/7/9/12/14/20     | (x) |
| Günter (GnF) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/9/10/12/14 |     |

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Result

2-2-0 a mixed result. I had originally the feeling that my pool was ok for a deck but after playing the first rounds I saw some cards that I'd value different in a sealed environment. Let's see how this can be adjusted for the next pre releases
