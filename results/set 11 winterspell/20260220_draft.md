# Raum Zeit Labor - Winterspell Draft

Together with Lorcanerds we followed up the tradition to have a draft night after the release of a new Lorcana set. The Raumzeit Labor offers plenty of space for this and we always have a good time. With 18 players participating in the first draft and 16 in the second draft round it was very enjoyful to open the cards and see play patterns.

## Tournament Rounds

### Round 1

First round was with Manuel - he was already a bit shocked, as we discussed my top end in the draft pool, where I got plenty of powerful cards incldued. I could overrun him then as well in the game.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 4         |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Anni and she played very aggressively using the Donald Duck combination with Alice. At the end she could play both an Eeyore and another card to place a lore gain that I could not come back from - otherwise I had a two turn clock on my end to finish the game as well.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 10        |     |
| Anni (ITFairy) | (x)  | 20        | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Alexander - he was not 100% happy with his draft pool and I could outplay that game by my top end curve.

#### Game 1

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                     | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Alexander (Randalex89) |      | 13        |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four was the first one with the new draft pool in which I got less top end but quite some evasives and evasive answers. Pairing was with Matthias and the evasives made the game

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Matthias (Jurki) |      | 14        |     |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

Round five Was then with Philipp who got the absolute nuts in the second draft round with multiple large evasives and bodyguards. I could answer some threats better than other players but overall could not cope with the two McHorn bodyguards then.

#### Game 1

| Player                | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                    |      | 20        |     |
| Philipp (Swordinator) | (x)  | 14        | (x) |

Result after round 5: **3-2-0**

### Round 6

Round six was with Alexander and there as well the evasives made the game.

#### Game 1

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                     |      | 20        | (x) |
| Alexander (TopChicken) | (x)  | 8         |     |

Result after round 5: **4-2-0**

### Result

4-2-0 after two draft rounds was a good result - and we had a lot of fun during the games. At the end some pins were provided in a lottery, as the main intend to the event was to have fun and not win something.
