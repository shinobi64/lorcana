### Round 1

First round was with Andre and he got a way better pool so he could outplay me on the evasive side and the card draw value.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Anni and her deck - she as well had some good pulls in her pool, so she could overwhelm me on the evasive side too.

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Ole and his powerful pool deck, especially around the removal and card draw he got way more options in his pool.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 1/2/3/4       |     |
| Ole (keo) |      | 1/4/6/7/11/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player    | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 3/5/10/16               |     |
| Ole (keo) |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **0-3-0**

### Result

0-3-0 was a terrible result, but already expected after I've seen my pool which lacked card draw, removal and evasive cards. I got at least two packs with nearly only items and no characters.
