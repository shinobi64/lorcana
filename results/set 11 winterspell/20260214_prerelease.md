### Round 2

Second round was with Andre and his deck - he had a huge pool of evasive characters which just ran over my board.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |

| Andre (andrecruz) |      | 1/3/5/7/11/15/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Annika, she had some good evasive characters as well - which carried the game one and three. Especially in game one she could pull off an interesting card draw from Scrooge McDuck together with a Tigger bounce. In the second game I could bring my characters well into play for a uncontested victory. In the last game I could not see the evasive answers which was bad as then the evasive characters quested for at least 10 lore.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round four pairing was with Oliver and his version of the sealed deck. His pool was a bit weaker than mine and I could outplay him especially with the larger bodies.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 2/4/6/8/10/13/20  | (x) |
| Oliver (Kroli) | (x)  | 2/5/8/10/12/13/14 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 2/4/9/16/20 | (x) |
| Oliver (Kroli) |      | 2/4/7       |     |

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Result

2-2-0 a mixed result. I knew that my pool was weak with regards to the evasive side - but being more or less without chance was still surprising.
