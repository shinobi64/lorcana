### Round 1

First round pairing was with Alma, and as usual she played an aggressive deck. This time an Amber Emerald version of dogs but with some new tricks. I lost the first game due to the Snow Fort which I could not remove. In the second and third game I could use the Tigger for control and bring in Wasabi right after the item was deployed.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Dennis aka. Corvus from the Dark Wings team. He was on a Ruby Amethyst deck still with set 10 cards. I lost the dice roll again and he could curve out early on very good. I was able to claw back in the mid section of game one but he kept drawing good cards - we had six Demonas out on the board in the end - so I could not remove everything. In the second game I was able to go fast and get into a dominant position. In game three he curved out again perfectly into all the two quest characters and by this just generate a lot of lore advantage which I could not regain. It were three intense good games and we had a good chat over it as well.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Daniel. He was on a variant of the Amethyst Emerald control aka. Brainiac deck. He included the new item Retro Evolution Device to cheat out larger characters early on. The first game was a full grind where he won due to the fact he could clear my board twice using the Under the Sea. In the second game I was quick on getting the control in place and then drive from there. In the last game I missed my ramp and Daniel took advantage from playing early Bend to My Will to strip me of options of a come back.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round four pairing was with Philipp and his Ruby Steel challenger deck. This was quite an easy matchup for me, as all the synergy in the Ruby Steel deck comes from challenging. By preventing this and challenge on my terms I was able to clear the board and keep card advantage on my side.

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Round 5

Win and in round against Matthias from the Brothers in Lore team. He was on Amethyst Steel with some new cards and he won the dice roll. In the first game he could directly curve out from start and by this generate board and lore advantage which I could not come back from. While being on the play in the second game I could not find any card draw, nor any Demona despite being nearly through half my deck - he on the other hand had one great and impactful top deck after each other.

| Matthias (MatDembo) |      | 2/4/8/9/10/11/12/13/15/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **2-3-0**

### Result

2-3-0 is a mixed result - I had expected a bit more aggro matchups/ my pairings were not 100% favorable. Especially being paired against the brainiac deck instead of either other Amethyst Sapphire or Amber Ruby deck was unfortunate and would have changed the path. Still the deck felt good and stable - however in a full control mirror world it has too less general board wipes available.
