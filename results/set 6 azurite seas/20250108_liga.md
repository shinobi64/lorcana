# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizards Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/223862. First one for the new year and kind of the last Wizards liga event before the set champion season starts.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used my updated Ruby Sapphire control list to test against Manuel. He was on his aggressive Amber Emerald deck with questers like Pegasus and Daisy. In the games where he was able to put out multiple Daisys I really did not stood a chance. However if the start is a bit slower I was able to counter this with an aggressive ramp to Maui Shark to get the board stalled and cycle actions.

| Manuel (Darksteel1) | (x)  | 2/8/12/17/20 | (x) |

### Match 2

In the second match Manuel switched to his Ruby Sapphire deck to test out the mirror matches. His deck build is more around McDucks Manor and SuperGoof/ Flynn to pressure more lore early, while mine is more late game optimized. I was able to clear out the Manors with Maui quite quickly and by this I could get into the late game and run out my value cards there.

| Manuel (Darksteel1) | (x)  | 2/6/8/10/12/14/16/14 |     |

### Match 3

The third match was played in between rounds with Harkan, as we finished the aggro matchup pretty quickly. He tried out a variant of Ruby Steel pirates with locations and John Silver. I was able to stall his lore gain and put characters by myself on the board in the late game and then quest to victory.

## Tournament Rounds

For the main liga I used the Ruby Sapphire Mufasa list (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/rnUt0vRUh4LS42rzGY1s) with the updated insights from the last weekend. I put back the Lucky Dime and increased the number of Maui Shark cards. On the flip side Madame Medusa was cut from the list to keep the number of uninkables to the same 15 as this feels "good" and does not brick to much.

3 Tamatoa - So Shiny!
4 Maleficent - Monstrous Dragon

1 Hide Away
1 Vitalisphere
1 Lucky Dime

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Harkan, who ran a very aggressive Amber Emerald list, mainly around 1 willpower characters that quest for much. As he won the dice roll it was an uphill battle which I was nearly able to turn in the second game, but on the draw there was no chance to counter it.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount       | Win |

| Harkan (Dlawmore) |      | 1/7/13/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Matthias, who ran a Ruby Steel build which was focused around challenging. This includes cards like the Queen of Hearts which gives you card draw upon challenge or Sherekan who provides lore gain upon challenge. In combination with my deck this did not work out to good, as my matchup is not so much focused on challenging, rather direct removal. I lost the dice roll again and had to claw back in the first game - however this worked good. In the second game I was not finding any large removal card until the end of the game and could not stall as much as needed. After the match we discussed his deck list a bit and I recommended some minor changes which for me would improve his decklist.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Manuel and his Ruby Sapphire control deck. As in the casual matches we're now in mirror match land. I lost the dice roll for the third straight time and had to deal with his aggressive Manor strategy in both games. I could develop my Lucky Dime in both games and use it to gain lore and close faster than he could.

#### Game 2

| Manuel (Darksteel1) | (x)  | 2/4/6/8/9/13      |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

Deck updates really feel good - despite the known weakness against the very aggressive decks. The cut of Medusa did not felt as bad as I thought originally, but some more testing is needed to confirm this.

In addition to the normal result table, I build up the matchup table, to see which matchups had been there, and which decks overcame their odds, or which decks had good matchups.
