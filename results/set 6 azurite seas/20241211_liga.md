# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizards Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/185600. After the continental championships last weekend there were a few decks out which resembled the top decks from that event.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used the Sapphire Steel damage deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/DEiyVjOvlLUtlZWf0Q6Y which is quite a fun one into the more aggressive decks that are out there, especially as well the Amethyst Emerald tempo decks. It's using Calhoun to get lore from challenges, as well as Jim Hawkins and his shift line for dealing damage. Baymax is included for non interactive lore gain and healing. Günther was playing an Emerald Sapphire build which was trying to combo around songs - but this did not worked out against my deck build.

| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 2/4            |     |

### Match 2

In the second match Günther switched over to the Amber Ruby location control deck build around the Sugarrush Speedway combination. This one is interesting, as with quite less ink you can achieve some interesting lore gains and card draw.

## Tournament Rounds

For the main liga I used the Amber Ruby Mufasa list (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/1ooUFP0UAfI8Ek5Ieffg) as this looks still like a promising candidate for the next events. Due to recent testing I switched out the new Simba and Judy Hops cards against Raya and Stitch. Raya's effect is quite strong, especially when paired with Gaston - Stitch on the flip side may be a 4/6 vanilla card, but the 4 strength are an important statline, similar to the 6 willpower.

3 The Library - A Gift for Belle

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Anni, who ran a modified version of Ruby Sapphire control with Sisu. She included Raya and the rush Queen of Hearts in her deck line. In the games she was not fast enough to close out the games - while I was able to advance the lore count more quickly. Especially in the last game she was as well screwed for card draw, which made it hard to combat my consistent threats.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Andreas (Andi), who used the Emerald Steel Beast One Turn Kill (OTK) deck, which is based on the legendary Beast from set 2 and doing constantly damage to ready up the Beast again. In game one he was able to find all three combo pieces, while in the two other games I could get the game under control and quest away for victory.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Ingo and his classic Ruby Amethyst bounce control deck. In the first game I was able to go aggressive enough to control his board with multiple Calhouns and then quest to victory. In the second and third game his draws have been way better and my early game much worse, so I could not ramp up my lore as quickly as he could.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

While this has been the first few games with the deck, it still felt ok - it's more midrange oriented, but not as much as with cards like Tinkerbell - so there is still some aggressive game play needed to outrun the more control oriented decks. Having Library out with the characters in really helps - and a well places Hades can be very devastating to the opponents board.
