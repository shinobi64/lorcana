# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

Second week into the liga of the Card Club - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/228594. This time we only had 11 participants which led to the awkward situation that one player always got a bye assigned.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

Günther asked me for some matchups into his Amber Steel songs build with my Ruby Sapphire deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/yZvTjJxXWXQlStq4YMlA. We played one game with closed hands and one with open hands to better discuss the moves and why certain choices would be made/ not made.

## Tournament Rounds

I wanted this week to do something else than always another variation of the Ruby Sapphire list. So I opted to use a list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/uINd94qGDcfQW2DLcUsa similar to Harlan Sweete's list with a more aggressive version. This for sure took some opponents by surprise but folded against the typical control suspects.

4 Mr. Smee - Bumbling Mate
4 Calhoun - Marine Sergeant
4 Cogsworth - Grandfather Clock
4 Gantu - Captain Crankyhead
4 Robin Hood - Beloved Outlaw
4 Robin Hood - Champion of Sherwood
3 McDuck Manor - Scrooge's Mansion
4 Pete - Games Referee
4 Pluto - Guard Dog
4 Alice - Savvy Sailor
2 Baymax - Armored Companion
3 Doc - Bold Knight
4 Mickey Mouse - Food Fight Defender
3 John Silver - Ship's Cook
2 Scrooge McDuck - Afficionado of Antiquities
2 Ba-boom!
3 Strength of a Raging Fire
2 Beast - Tragic Hero

### Round 1

Round 1 was against Kira, who was in Hockenheim for the first time. She played an aggressive Amber Steel version using the low drops and as well the Drawen Mine. She was able to outplay me on the board as her list was closer on the ground than mine.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired against Chris and his Amethyst Emerald Tempo deck. Interestingly I was able to out tempo his build, as most of my characters had a better strenght/ willpower values to force more efficient trades on my end.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me with Matthias and his variant of Amber Steel songs. In the first game he got stuck on a lot of unusable cards, while then in second and thrid game the songs were flowing and have been able to remove my board efficiently. This was rather an expected loss from the matchup.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

As expected with a lot of more controlly decks the aggressive deck did not perform as good as another control deck. Still it had been a good move to take some time off from all the thinking on Ruby Sapphire moves.

In addition to the normal result table, I build up the matchup table, to see which matchups had been there, and which decks overcame their odds, or which decks had good matchups.
