# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizards Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/223863. First draft of the year and a special one, as we mixed up boosters from Set 4 Ursulas Return and Set 5 Shimmering Skies.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used my updated Ruby Sapphire control list to test against Manuel. He was on a Amethyst Sapphire Blurple list which build around Hades, Elsa and McDuck Mannor for lore gain. I was able to clear the locations efficiently and by that could be going to the 20 lore gain.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                  | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Manuel (Darksteel1) |      | 12        |     |

### Match 2

In the second match I played a Ruby Sapphire mirror into Jerry - who was very successful on the weekend with his Ruby Sapphire list. Still I could outvalue him by playing the Lucky Dime at a better time and use the Fish Hook very efficiently.

#### Game 1

| Player                     | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| -------------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                         |      | 20        | (x) |
| Jerry (Tintenvorrat_Wooky) | (x)  | 6         |     |

## Tournament Rounds

As it was a draft game I focused as usual on the higher value cards with evasive and high strenght and willpower. Especially Cri-Kee was a good stalemate breaker which secured me more than one game.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Harkan - it was his first draft and the deck was not very consistent and showed more the classic constructed value of cards which is slightly different in sealed formats.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 4/3/10/9/20 | (X) |
| Harkan (Dlawmore) |      | 1/2/3/5/8   |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/3/5/6/8/10/17/20 | (X) |
| Harkan (Dlawmore) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/8/10/11    |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Andre, who got some good cards from the draft too - however he picked up the Sapphire Mufasa which let him go into a late ramp game - where I was able to outvalue him before.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 7/13/20   | (x) |
| Andre (Putschi) |      | 1/2/3     |     |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me              |      | 3/8/13/14/20 | (x) |
| Andre (Putschi) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/8    |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Manuel and his draft result. I was again able to quickly lore up in the first game. In the second game the Madame Mim Elefant did a lot of work on his side clearing the board on my side. In the last game I managed to take out the Elefant early on and then slam a lot of evasive questers onto the board.

#### Game 1
