### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Kira and her Amber Steel Mufasa build which was inspired by Earlmeister's list. In both games I was not able to hit my ramp pieces, so she could quickly quest ahead of me and secure the win. As well this round was the start of the worst sequence of dice rolls I ever had in a tournament, as I started all five rounds on the draw.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/2/3/5/7               |     |
| Kira (RoXion) | (x)  | 1/5/9/11/13/15/17/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |

| Kira (RoXion) |      | 1/5/9/13/15/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Pierre and his version of Amber Steel Aggro with Dwarwen Mine. Again I started on the draw but got a good recovery in the first game, as I could stall him out at 19 lore and then claw back with Sharks and Pirates Life cycles. In the second game he could then quickly get to 20 lore and secure the win. Last game I was finally on the play and could apply pressure early on - so giving him only a small lead which was then manageable with the late control cards.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Felix and his Ruby Amethyst Bounce build. This is a tough matchup for me, as he could usually outvalue me by the amount of card draw included in the deck. We got a back and forth - but unfortunately in the third game I got a hard brick and no draw capabilities, so he could easily secure the win from there.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount                           | Win |

| Felix (Varolz) |      | 1/4/7/8/9/10/11/15/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

With 1-2-0 it was already crunch time to have even an outside chance to get into the Top 8. I got paired into Marco and his Amber Steel Songs build. We got some two very intensive games, where in the second game I lost due to deck out as he was able to cast all his four Whole New World cards during the game. In the last game then I was able to turbo ramp and put down two McDuck Manors after a Be Prepared - this was a situation that he could not recover from.

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Round 5

With 2-2-0 the top cut was still in reach due to the other mixed results on the top. I was paired into Martin and his Ruby Sapphire build. He won his game on the play and so did I with mine, but then we have been out of time - which unfortunately meant we both missed the top cut. Martin's deck was more optimized into the mirror match with Tamatoa and Lucky Dime included.

#### Game 1

| Martin (Malomi207) |      | 1/2/3/6/8/6/8/11              |     |

Result after round 5: **2-2-1**

### Result

With the draw in the last round I missed the top cut by one place. A bit unfortunate but not changeable, mainly the loss against Felix on my play was the downfall of the series.
