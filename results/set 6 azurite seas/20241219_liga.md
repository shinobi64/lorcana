# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Card Club was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/211538. It was the last event for this year, so a good number of players assembled - we would have been more but some we're prevented by sickness.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used the Amethyst Emerald tempo deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/Z0UGwQ7PYFXPmkU6a423 which is a deck focused on quick lore gain but be supported by all the good Amethyst cards for bouncing and card draws. I played against Aleandro who switched to a Ruby Steel pirates based deck with locations, Vaiana and John Silver. These locations are however very vulnerable against Fox and Crab so it was rather easy to get this deck under control.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Patrick N, who traditionally ran his Amber Amethyst hyper aggro deck which is build around fast lore gain and no interaction. I started on the draw which is not very good for this encounter and put me on the backfoot right from the start. In the first game I could not get into a control situation whatsoever. Second game went more in my favor with playing Sisu and Sisu shift - same was then luckily true in the third game too.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired against Andre and his Amber Steel aggro deck which is build around fast lore gain and the new Lilo combined with Simba and Pluto as protectors. In the first and last game Andre had it all to flood the board early and get it going. In the last game I was one card short of getting the control back which was unfortunate. Second game was in my favor putting the control grip out.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me with Günter and his Amethyst Steel midrange deck. This one runs Calhoun and Gantu together with the typical Amethyst package. As the games go a bit longer than with a more aggressive styled deck it's more in my favor as I can then stablize and take the game from there.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

Choosing the control deck and then facing two third aggro encounters was not the way I expected the evening to go. Still the deck feels very consistent and reliable - so even into challenging aggressive decks a win is possible, if the opponent is not getting the full nuts hand. Glad für Sören to take the first liga win.
