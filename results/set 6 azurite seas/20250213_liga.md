Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Round 1

Round 1 against Matthias and his Emerald Ruby actions deck. The core is around playing Robin Sharpshooter out and the consistenly quest and play actions for free. As I was able to start game 1 and game 3 I could ramp, offer no targets early on and then take the board with Be Prepared and Maui Sharks.

#### Game 1

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired with Mathias Jan and his Amber Steel songs build. Again I was able to start and had good cards in place to counter the early aggressions to then take the late game onto my side. In second game I was more on my back foot, as Jan was able to play out early on two Lilos so he could recur them and force me to make consistent trades instead of advancing my own game. In the last game I could close the game with double McDuck Manor and consecutive Be Prepared plays.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Last round was with Alex and the Amethyst Steel locations deck from Jan. He got as well to win the dice roll, so it was clear this would be a tight game to get. I digged deep in the mulligans to have Maui Hero to All on my hand to deal with the locations efficiently. In addition I could find the Go the Distance and utilize Tipo to sing it, so I could get two swings out of Maui each time.

#### Game 1

| Alex (Alex8289) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/6/7/8 |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Result

So testing the new cards was interesting. I'll still need to decide depending on what I'd expect from a matchup perspective for which specific angle to pivot the deck for the weekend.
