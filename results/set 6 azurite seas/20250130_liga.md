# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

Another week in set champs seasion with liga of the Card Club - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/236239. Due to current sickness period we have been just eight players this time.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I played with Pierre to further test the Emerald Sapphire Discard list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/zzoyKabxvmlNJubMs87n. Pierre was on his Amber Steel Mine list which is very hard to get, especially if the needed ramp pieces/ control pieces are not there. In both games I missed out in either or of them, so I could not get the board control back.

### Match 2

Second match was with Günther, where he tested out his version of Emerald Sapphire Discard. I went onto a fun build with Amethyst Steel and Locations https://dreamborn.ink/decks/X3yKhPcxF2vxRmPG4liF. The locations added enough board pressure which the Emerald Sapphire deck is really bad handling.

### Match 3

Last casual match was against Nils, who wanted to wanted to practice his Amber Steel Mine Locations build. This deck includes Fix It Felix as additional synergy with the locations. I was still on my Amethyst Steel Locations build. In the second game, he got all the Daisy Ducks out which he needed, and I was not able to find a Madame Mim Fox. Last game was very close.

### Round 1

Round 1 was against Sören, who was on the Amber Steel mine build. I was able to outvalue him in the first game where I was on the draw, second game he got the nuts hand and in the third game I could take over again, as his draws were just average.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired against Alex and his Amethyst Emerald tempo list. I was in a very solid state in the first game, but then only drew four rounds of uninkables with not being able to play anything - this was such a huge tempo loss I could not recover from it. Same happended then basically in the third game, so I was giving this to Alex.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me with Matthias and his adopted Amber Steel songs deck. Again I was not hitting anything solid in game 1 so it was a given game to Matthias. In game two I could get into the controlling state needed. In the third game I was in a good spot, but he top decked everything he needed, including songs, three Lilo and as well the Flutes - so no chance there, especially as my control cards have all been on the bottom of the deck.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

Ruby Amethyst was a good pick for the list of decks in the field. However the draws and the bricks did not allow for a better result. I was unfortunately a bit salty due to this experience in multiple games after each other. Still need to consider if this is a viable pick for the tournaments on the weekend.

In addition to the normal result table, I build up the matchup table, to see which matchups had been there, and which decks overcame their odds, or which decks had good matchups.
