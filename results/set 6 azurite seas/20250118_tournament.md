# Cool Speyer Set Championship Azurite Seas

First set championship is in the books. This event was in the Cool trading card store in Speyer. Andre won there last set with a Amber Steel songs deck. This time the field of players was rather competetive and provided a bigger challenge to gain into the Top 8. Melee tournament link https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/213415

## Tournament Rounds

I updated my Ruby Sapphire Deck a bit based on the recent discussions with Moyen. Especially to have more counters against top line heavy meta - which was not the case. Decklist https://dreamborn.ink/decks/xCsbfmGnHaWvocrp7gNd shows the iteration. The Lucky Dime was able to be important in some games - same goes for the Scar as surprise factor.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Jerry and as he has been on Ruby Sapphire too, directly into a mirror match. As theme of the day I lost my dice roll to start on the back foot. However my top end was better than his and due to this I could counter his threats, especially as well the locations.

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Alex, who knew pretty well what I was running. I knew that he was on Amber Steel aggro Dwarven Mine build. Again I lost the dice roll and in addition he drew two times nearly perfect hands. Especially during my game on the play he was able to bring in four mines out of his top 20 cards, combined with two Daisy, two Lilo and Mr. Smee and Lawrence I could not counter the aggression.

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into G端nther and his Amber Steel songs build. We had practiced last week a lot, especially with open hands to go through the decision processes and options. In the first game I was able to get into my game plan, while in game two he could run the full aggression line. In game three I could then close out the game in my favor quickly enough.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

With the state of 2-1-0 it was already make or break in that round. I was paired into Lukas - so yet another mirror. We're pretty certain that whoever would loose would be out of the potential Top 8. Luckly for me I was able to get the first win of the dice roll - which gave me a tiny advantage. In game two it was an absolute coin toss - if Lukas would have not closed in his turn I would have closed in my next turn. We agreed then to keep it as a draw as we only had 5 minutes left after the two games. With a draw it finally meant we have to win our next game to get into the top cut.

Result after round 4: **2-1-1**

### Round 5

Round 5 paired me then into Matthias with his Amber Steel songs deck. He was not very amused with the matchup, as it was the decisive game for both of us. He got the better start into game one, so I could not convert my advantage of the dice roll. Game two was then a kind of auto win, as Matthias was very much bricked. Game three was then a full battle where Matthias could play a lot of agression and Lilo recursion, while I could control it and then close it with the Lucky Dime - but it was very close and nerve wracking.

### Top 8

Top cut reached meant the promo card was save. Against all the odds I was paired with Lukas again. He was one place better after round 5, so he had the start rights. In addition in game one he had the god hand for the deck. I'd never seen that a Ruby Sapphire player kept all his seven cards. On the flip side I was better positioned in game two. With little time left we knew it would come down to a draw like situation, where in top cut the gained lore acts as tie breaker. Lukas got there a bit faster but pushed out all his removals to stabilize in the extra turns - two turns more and it would have been my game. We both had been very exhausted after that intense game.

Result after round 6: **3-2-1**

### Result

With reaching top cut, the promo card was secured and the goal for participation was reached. I think the bring was proper for the meta seen, however the matchup tree was as bad as it could be. To see with three Ruby Sapphire decks in six rounds three mirrors is nearly impossible.
