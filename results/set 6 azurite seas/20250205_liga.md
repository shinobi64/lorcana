# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

After a week of break back into normal liga cycle - melee details https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/238858

## Casual Rounds

As there was only casual play, we tested some deck strategies in light of the last set championship weekend for the set.

### Match 1

In the first match I used my newly build Amber Steel Mufasa build to check if it's any good. I set up with Romwald and his Ruby Amethyst deck. He added some additional cards for a better deck consistency.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/3/5/8/10                          |     |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/16/20 | (x) |

### Match 2

Second match was then the same deck on my side against Andre and his Sapphire Steel tempo deck.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount    | Win |

## Tournament Rounds

I decided to go with an off meta deck to see if there is any legs in Ruby Steel pirates as eventual counter for the overly present Diggy Diggy Hole decks. Deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/1zUHig5NKSYfKb5mV8KB got inspired by some Ruby Steel discussions on the Podcana discord server.

4 Flynn Rider - Frenemy
4 Sisu - Emboldened Warrior
4 Brawl
3 Calhoun - Marine Sergeant
4 Doc - Bold Knight
3 Pete - Games Referee
4 Seven Dwarfs' Mine - Secure Fortress
4 Mr. Smee - Bumbling Mate
2 And Then Along Came Zeus
4 Let the Storm Rage On
3 Strength of a Raging Fire
4 Moana - Self-Taught Sailor
4 John Silver - Ship's Cook
4 Mickey Mouse - Food Fight Defender
3 Maui - Hero to All
2 Fire the Cannons!
2 Mickey Mouse - Pirate Captain
2 Beast - Tragic Hero
2 John Silver - Stern Captain

Main idea is to combine the strengths of the staple steel cards from the Diggy Diggy Hole list with the good early Ruby cards to establish some board control, especially then with Maui. Card draw is realized by Doc and Beast, as there is no similar effect to Rapunzel available in this color pair.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Nico and his Emerald Sapphire Discard deck. As the majority of my deck is with three strength and higher the effect of the Muses to bounce cards back was not as effective - so I could quest ahead to victory in both games.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/4/8/14/15/20 | (X) |
| Nico (NicoGräber) | (x)  |                |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/5/8/11/20 | (X) |
| Nico (NicoGräber) | (x)  | 2             |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me with Romwald and his Ruby Amethyst deck. As I knew what to expect from the casual games I knew this would be a hard matchup. Especially as in the later stage of the games his control cards are more effective and in addition the card draw is better in Ruby Amethyst.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/4/7/13/18/19/20 | (X) |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 2/3/5             |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/8/10/12/13/15        |     |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 1/3/6/8/9/10/12/13/17/20 | (X) |

#### Game 3

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/8/9/12/14/15/16/17/19   |     |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/16/20 | (X) |

Result after round 1: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me then into Andre and his Amber Steel Songs deck. Usually I'd not be favored into this matchup, as his song control options are too effective. On the flip side the need on his side to play A Whole New World would benefit me, as my card draw is rather limited. I got in the two games on the play the better starts and could force a board state which could not be controlled anymore by Andre. In the second game Andre was able to establish early on a lot of pressure and by this extend his lead which I could not regain anymore.

#### Game 1

### Result

The deck performed good, with the challenging matchups into control decks as previously expected. I think this can be explored further.

Matchup Matrix was quite easy due to limited number of participants
