## Tournament Rounds

Inspired by Dhin's performance in Melbourne I gave the more inkable midrange based version of Ruby Sapphire a try https://dreamborn.ink/decks/q26MuE1ume86jGxPRWo0, but included two Sisu for additional surprise and possible control into the expected aggro world.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Manuel and his pet deck - Emerald Sapphire Discard. Contrary to the day before I got more lucky with my dice rolls and was able to start. In both games on the play I could ramp and put down my value pieces, especially the McDuck Manor, a card that has little answers in Manuels deck.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into the other Manuel and his Ruby Amethyst deck. As Manuel is a very experienced player I could not count on any misplays on his side and knew it would be a tough matchup. I finally lost in the last game to the famous Goat bounce loop and could not find any Be Prepared to earlier get the board state back.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Jonas, who usually plays in Karlsruhe, but was this time in Mannheim together with his brother. He played his signature Ruby Sapphire deck but in a more classic setup. I suprised him especially with the Sisu in my list as he assumed I played the Dhin list as net deck. By that I got a full board wipe on his key pieces like Flaversham and little Sisu. Unfortunately in the second game I could not find the final Pirates Life early enough to close the game, so we had to do the last game too.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

With a intermediate result of 2-1-0 it still meant it was close to get into the topcut. I was paired into Ole and his Amber Steel songs deck. As spicy card he included a Chernabog as kind of top end character and as well an insurance against all removal decks. Unfortunately he was very unlucky with his draws, so I could get the first game into my favor and as well in the last game rather play the aggressor and by this close it out.

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Achim and his Amber Steel aggro build. Based on the math and the standings we agreed on an intentional draw to secure both of us into the Top 8.

Result after round 5: **3-1-1**

### Top 8

Top 8 round paired me into Andre and his Amber Steel aggro build. He was higher seed after the swiss phase so could start off. In both games my deck refused cooperation, sending me each time three Be Prepared cards to hand after the mulligan. Due to this I could never get into the game at all and he could run away with it.

#### Game 1

| Andre (nastra) |      | 2/6/8/11/12/13/15/16/20 | (x) |

Result after top 8: **eliminated**

### Result

With reaching Top 8 I secured another Scar promotion card - I think given the population of 50% Amber Steel aggro decks in the top 8 no real better result would have been possible. Still I had hoped for at least a fighting chance in the top 8 games.
