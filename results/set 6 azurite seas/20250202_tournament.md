## Tournament Rounds

Another try with Ruby Sapphire Control - I still have a very good feeling on the deck, especially into more Steel based metas. This was not the case yesterday - but found this our too late. Deck is running low on uninkable cards to allow consistent ramp on turn 2. https://dreamborn.ink/decks/SNqJycqw6yyA5qWBHzIM

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Romwald and his Amethyst Steel Midrange deck. In the first game he had two perfect timed Along Came Zeus cards to remove my Half Sharks and leave me a bit down in the dust. In both other games I was able to take over control and as well establish the McDuck Manors as additional pressure point.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Tim, who is a consistent Ruby Amethyst player and as well in this event he brought that deck. Using a rather standard line he was able to easily beat me due to the early pressure from Flynn and Sisu and his constant card draw.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me            |      |                 |     |

| Tim (TimBlim) |      | 1/2/4/5/3/4/6/9/10/12/13/14/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Maddon and his interesting build around Ruby Steel Pirates with locations. His key elements are the locations with quite a high willpower and then the combination of John Silver supporting all other pirates as captain and gaining more lore for each location in play. Luckily I had enough Maui Hero to All in my deck to effectively counter the locations and then combined with Maui Half Shark to lock down the board.

#### Game 1

| Maddon (Maddon) |      | 2/3/5/6/10/12/16/17/15 |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

2-1-0 meant another win would make certain to reach the topcut. I was paired into Tobi from team TaL and his Emerald Amethyst Tempo deck. I was able the secure the first game with double shark action. In the second game he had an optimal start with Merfolk and Banzei and made use of the GoGo bounce effect to gain lore. The last game was very close and we had a state of 17 to 17 locked down, he drew his only out to bounce the GoGo and win with it, due to the damage on my Hiram. I could have played in my turn Be Prepared to not allow this, but my own hand was not strong so I was afraid of not comming back from it.

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Round 5

As I was now on 2-2-0 it was pretty clear the top cut was gone, there was around 1 to 2 spots for a 3-2-0 result but my tie breaker was not good at this point in time. I was paired into Hendrik with an Amber Emerald Discard deck - something rarely seen in this set. He had the nuts opening in game one and could close it pretty quickly, while in game two and three I could setup my pieces properly and his deck has usually nothing to wipe the sharks away, except You're Welcome and We Don't Talk About Bruno. The latter one can be hedged against with keeping some cards in hand.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1             |     |
| Hendrik (Seretim) | (x)  | 1/3/4/8/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 3/4/6/7/9/11/15/18/20 | (x) |
| Hendrik (Seretim) |      | 1/0/1/2/0             |     |

#### Game 3

| ----------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/2/4/5/8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/20 | (x) |
| Hendrik (Seretim) | (x)  | 1/4/7/9/7/8                               |     |

Result after round 5: **3-2-0**

### Result

Due to the bad tie breaker I ended up on place 10 - equal points to place 8 which would have been the top cut, but still I was ok with my perfomance. Looking back it could have been the decision in game 3 of round 4 which made the difference - but you nether know.
