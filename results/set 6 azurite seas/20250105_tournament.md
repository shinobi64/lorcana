# Multivitamin WebCam Tournament New Year Edition

This was a very special tournament organized by G_able as part of his tournament series. It was a pure webcam based tournament with a chance to win a D23 collectors box. This was incentive enough to motivate 49 players in total. Overall the event ran very smoothly and I even managed to get into a stream - where I made a very basic mistake - how embarrassing. Melee link for the tournament to follow up with the details is https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/209645. The complete list of decks could be found at https://inkdecks.com/lorcana-tournaments/multivitamin-webcam-turnier-2-tournament-decks-1866 - and the full stream is published on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOYAWdY1B2E. What was in addition special was the open decklist concept - means everyone knew all deckslists of the opponent and could look it up during the game. This helped a lot with counting cards like removal options.

## Tournament Rounds

I used an adopted Ruby Sapphire control deck as my main deck for the tournament. I originally expected a meta game which was more intense on Amber Steel songs than on the Ruby Amethyst it has been. This caused me to cut on Lucky Dime and tech a bit more against aggro - which was not as efficient into the Ruby Amethyst matches or the mirror matches on Ruby Sapphire.

### Round 1

Round one was into Patrick on a Sapphire Steel list - a traditionally favored matchup for me. I could capitalize on my better late game and could avoid the negative impacts from the Whole New World cards.

### Round 2

Round two paired me into Baris and his Ruby Amethyst build. He had a bye in round 1 and we were the featured table on stream for that round. In the first game he got all the draws to go out quickly and the close the game, while in the second game I could bring out more value to the field. In that game I really missed my Lucky Dime as it would have made the match way easier.

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Marcus, whom I played against already last year in the set championship for Stitch. He as well was running a Ruby Amethyst deck - and we had the same kind of run as in the previous round so it ended in a draw.

### Round 4

Round 4 was a pairing into Daniel from the Playing Ducks team. He was on Ruby Sapphire control as well - and as expected the match ended in a draw. I could have made it a 2:0 if I would have found my "Hide Away" to get rid of his Lucky Dime - which finally won him the second game.

### Round 5

In round five I was paired with Michael, who was running an Amethyst Emerald Tempo deck. He was able to open multiple times with multiple Merfolks and Banzai, so I could not counter that aggression properly. He got two times as well some good value out of the GoGo plays - which have not been avoidable.

Result after round 3: **1-1-3**

### Round 6

The final round six paired me into Vladimiro from the Youtube channel Tota Hahn. He ran an Amber Steel songs list, which is highly unfavored against my deck. I could have gone 2:0 - but I made an oversight in game two which cost me the game. We had a good chat over the whole match.

### Result

It kind of felt bad that I made the adjustments to counter the more aggressive decks, while the tournament meta was more focused on control decks.
