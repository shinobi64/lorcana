### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Phillip and his standard Ruby Amethyst Bounce list. I was starting again on the draw with a loss of the dice roll and faced an uphill battle. I could get the game to a final draw but it was not a very satisfactory result.

#### Game 1

Result after round 1: **0-0-1**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Jerry and his version of Amber Steel Diggy Diggy Hole Aggro. I was able to start this time but in both games the lower character count in my deck got me into trouble as I could not bring pieces onto the board.

#### Game 1

| Player                    | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me                        | (x)  | 2/6/8                  |     |
| Jerry (Tintenvorat_Wooky) |      | 1/3/7/9/12/14/16/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player                    | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me                        | (x)  | 3/4                |     |
| Jerry (Tintenvorat_Wooky) |      | 2/4/8/9/7/10/15/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-1-1**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Benjamin and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. Blurple is a tough matchup for my deck and Benni really got all the card draw he needed onto his side. I was out valued in game one, could close fast in game two and lost to a double goat on game three in the extra turns.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                     | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----------------------------- | --- |

| Benjamin (Linlaen) |      | 1/2/3/5/7/8/10/14/12/14/15/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                    | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------- | --- |

| Benjamin (Linlaen) |      | 1/2/4/7/5/6/7/5/7/11/9/10/11 |     |

#### Game 3

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                                                 | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 1/2/4/6/7/8/9/11/12/15                                    |     |
| Benjamin (Linlaen) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/6/10/12/13/14/15/16/14/15/16/17/18/19/17/18/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **0-2-1**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me into the only other available Ruby Amethyst Bounce deck from Alexander. He won the dice roll, so again I faced a very diffcicult matchup. In game 1 and 3 the goats closed it again in his favor, while in the second one I could be more in favor. We just managed to complete the games before timeout was called.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                           | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 1/2/4/6/7/8/10/12/15/17/18/19       |     |
| Alexander (_Alex_) | (x)  | 1/4/5/6/7/9/11/13/16/18/16/17/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Alexander (_Alex_) | (x)  | 1/4/5/6/7/8/10/11/9/11/12/15/16/17/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **0-3-1**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Günther and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. His build was quite different than the one from Benjamin and more or less for the first time in that tournament I got draws together which allowed a continous match play.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/2/3/6/7/10/11/13/16/20 | (x) |
| Günther (GNF) |      | 1/4/6/4/2                |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                      | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------------ | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/2/5/6/7/10/11/14/15/17/19/20 | (x) |
| Günther (GNF) | (x)  | 1/3/4/5/7/9/7/8/6/4            |     |

Result after round 5: **1-3-1**

### Result

I was absolutely unsatisfied with my own performance in this set championship. Yes the matchups have been all challenging, and by my own luck I was paired into the only two Ruby Amethyst decks in the tournament - but still on the draw it often times felt like there was no chance at all.
