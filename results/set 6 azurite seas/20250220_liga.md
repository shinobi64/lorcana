## Tournament Rounds

I went again with Ruby Sapphire Control https://dreamborn.ink/decks/og9H3QilenN0U9vYICoA in a version backwards tailored for less mirror matched but a more versatile midrange focus. I cut the Sisu and opted for two Scars as additional board control options.

### Round 1

Round 1 against Anni and her Ruby Sapphire Control list. As she's playing more into the control aspect and less into the midrange aspect I could overwhelm her with early lore gain and late board control with Shark and just spamming Be Prepareds into the board with my McDuck Manors.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |

| Anni (Ironlady94) |      | 1/0/2/5/8/11               |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/6/8/10/14/18/20 | (x) |
| Anni (Ironlady94) | (x)  | 1                   |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was against Patrick and his Ruby Steel Challenger deck. I needed to run there a bit more careful as the challenge matters aspect is not to be underestimated. However I could get my pieces positioned and bait a Be Prepared out of him to follow up with Manors - while his card draw was quite limited.

#### Game 1

| Patrick (Marzipan87) | (x)  | 1/4/6/9/13/14/12/14/12/13          |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Last round was then against Manuel and his rather classic Sapphire Steel build. He had a bad starting hand in game one and in game two my Scar came out clutch to clear the Arielle and let me win via McDuck Manors.

### Result

It felt really good to have some smooth matches after the struggle in the last weeks, especially during the set championship - interestingly the list is now near the same than back then.
