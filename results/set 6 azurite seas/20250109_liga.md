# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

Second week into the liga of the Card Club - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/224812. Again 12 players attended the event - which allowed for a lot of interesting matches.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

In the first match I tested the Amethyst Sapphire Blurple build which Anni is keeping an eye on as deck for the upcomming set championships. Decklist is on https://dreamborn.ink/decks/SgmBhL6vJWowNDnKM29q - this list uses three Hades and three shift Elsas as control options together with the ramp and bounce package. Main idea is to go fast and use the ramp the a reoccurent card draw to gain the advantage. Weakness is against decks which can go wide very fast, as there is no mass control tools in those colors.

I played against Alex who was using an Amber Steel songs list using Robin shift line. This deck is one of the weaker matchups as it can go wide and still generate enough card draw using the Whole New World.

### Match 2

Second match against Alex was with switched decks. I opted for the Amber Steel aggro build filled up with Mufasa as try for Fiona - https://dreamborn.ink/decks/t42Jx14w3cdkgyxXEdDB. Alex went for an Amethyst Steel midrange build filled with evasive characters. I was not able to deal enough damage to the evasive ones or pressure enough lore early on to make this game work.

## Tournament Rounds

In order to prepare for the next larger event I wanted to further test my Ruby Sapphire list. I adopted some learnings from the last weekends tournament to make it a bit more resilient - however it's still deceptive against aggressive decks. Dreamborn list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/rnUt0vRUh4LS42rzGY1s - main difference to last week is the inclusion of the lucky dime again to counter the Ruby Amethyst decks, plus extension of Shark to four and more actions around it. To counter the mirror matches more large dragons have been included. I skipped the Medusa in favor of Shark, despite it not being a removal. To flip that up I increased the number of Be Prepared from two to three.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Lukas, who opted to play an Amber Steel songs deck from Alex instead of his own build Ruby Amethyst deck. As soon as he recognized my Ruby Sapphire deck he was not very happy. In the first game it kind of went ok for the first few steps, but then he missed with Ariel multiple times, same in game two and then it was basically over.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired against Manuel who ran an interesting variant of Emerald Sapphire with Clarabelle and Bend to My Will. In the first game his ramp plan worked perfect and I got no way back into the game. In the second and third game he struggled to find removal against my characters and I could safely quest to victory.

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me with Alexander and his Amethyst Steel midrange deck. In the first game I was able to stabilize and turn the tides mid game. In the second one he curved out early and I could not find a board removal in the first half of my deck. Last game was then won by multiple Sharks and action play.

### Result

With those many Amber Steel decks and other Ruby Sapphire decks around the choice for the control deck, especially with the adoptions really paid off. I feel confident for the weekend with the deck.

In addition to the normal result table, I build up the matchup table, to see which matchups had been there, and which decks overcame their odds, or which decks had good matchups.
