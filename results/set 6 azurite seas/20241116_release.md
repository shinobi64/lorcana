# Wizards Well - Azurite Seas Release Event

As the new set Azurite Seas came out on November 15th there was as usual a release event in the Well. Traditionally this is played as sealed to allow the players to stock up on new cards. https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/175002

## Tournament Rounds

My sealed pool did not contain any legendary cards and only one super rare. As well the evasive cards were kind of thin and all top end cards seemed uninkable. Using this I opted for some value plays, shift lines and pirate synergies to make most out of the available cards.

### Round 1

The first round was against Lukas who got two legendary cards from his pool and as well his other cards have been pretty busted. I went down on the games where I was on the draw but snagged a win while being on the play. In the two games on the play I never really had a chance.

### Round 4

Round four paired me into Mohammed, who was there for the first time. He never could get his deck really going and I always felt like one step ahead, even in the game on the draw.

| Mo (Seynara) | (x)  | 1/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 |     |

Result after round 3: **3-1-0**

### Result

Overall we had a good event again. Was quite some fun to play with the new cards and discover potential synergies as we went along. I finished on 5th place due to the tiebreakers. Anni was able to go for second place and she was quite happy about it.
