# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

Another week in set champs seasion with liga of the Card Club - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/238956. Kind of maximum number of weekly players with 14 - we even had to extend to the middle tables.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I played with Janina to teach her some basic moves in the game and explain along while we played. She has used the Amber Steel Mine deck. I used the Amber Ruby Mufasa build https://dreamborn.ink/decks/YiMalEOC728glpSM1RIA from Fiona to give it another run.

### Round 1

Round 1 was against Chris, who was again on his Amethyst Emerald tempo list. As usual he found the multiple Merfolk card in his openings and we splitted the games along the play draw lines. Especially in the last game he was able to close out with Go Go and a Goat, otherwise it would have tipped into my favor. Especially in the second game I was able to create the Go The Distance cycle and by this clearing out multiple excerted characters while gaining lore and drawing cards - what a great feeling.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired with Mathias Jan and his Amethyst Steel Locations deck. I made two mistakes in both games, which most likely have cost me the games, but as well I was not drawing well in either games, especially not finding the rush Maui cards I would have needed against the Locations.

#### Game 1

| Player                   | Play | Lorecount                         | Win |

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me with Janina and her Amber Steel Mine deck - like in the casual matches before. I was able to create the Go The Distance loops again and could as well utilize the Pirates Life cycles to my advantage.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount                     | Win |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

So testing the new cards was interesting. I'll still need to decide depending on what I'd expect from a matchup perspective for which specific angle to pivot the deck for the weekend.

In addition to the normal result table, I build up the matchup table, to see which matchups had been there, and which decks overcame their odds, or which decks had good matchups.
