# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizards Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/185595. It was the first constructed liga game in the new set - so there was some hype to see which decks everyone brought in.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used the Amber Ruby Mufasa deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/1ooUFP0UAfI8Ek5Ieffg which is in the closer round of possible picks against Manuel with an Amethyst Emerald Tempo build. I was however in all three games not able to find the optimal curve, especially not the combinations of Mother Gothel and Rapunzel to fill up my hand. On the other side I had to drop cards due to clearing the Cursed Merfolk.

| Manuel S |      | 1/3/4/5/7/9/11/20 | (x) |

### Match 2

In the second match I switched over to a more aggressive Amethyst Steel deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/bsYAym8Y3x9vDbPd07FZ which is build around Doc to refill the hand multiple times using the bounce effects. In the second game Manuel closed out with big Ursula which I was not able to handle efficiently - while at the same time I was not able to close out on my own turn anymore.

#### Game 1

### Match 3

In the third match we we're not able to finish the game, but setup was Ruby Sapphire Control https://dreamborn.ink/decks/BhY0yKZU58xZzMcVIiXl on my side against the Amethyst Emerald Tempo on Manuels side. At the state of play Manuel was ahead but I had all the cards in hand to turn the game over.

## Tournament Rounds

For the main liga I used the Amber Ruby Mufasa list (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/1ooUFP0UAfI8Ek5Ieffg) as this looks still like a promising candidate for the next events. Due to recent testing I switched out the new Simba and Judy Hops cards against Raya and Stitch. Raya's effect is quite strong, especially when paired with Gaston - Stitch on the flip side may be a 4/6 vanilla card, but the 4 strength are an important statline, similar to the 6 willpower.

4 Rapunzel - Gifted with Healing
2 Peter Pan - Pirate's Bane
4 Maui - Hero to All
3 Hydra - Deadly Serpent
4 Stitch - Carefree Surfer
4 Pluto - Friendly Pooch
1 Maleficent - Monstrous Dragon
1 Chernabog - Evildoer
3 Brawl
4 Mufasa - Betrayed Leader
4 Mother Gothel - Withered and Wicked
3 Card Soldiers - Full Deck
3 Doc - Leader of the Seven Dwarfs
4 Gaston - Despicable Dealer
2 Mulan - Injured Soldier
2 Sisu - Empowered Sibling
4 Sisu - Emboldened Warrior
1 Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Tailor
3 Raya - Kumandran Rider
2 Vanellope Von Schweetz - Random Roster Racer
2 Stitch - Abomination

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Anni, who ran a modified version of Sapphire Steel items using some of the new cards, e.g. Tadashi and Sail the Azurite Seas. She was however unlucky with the card draw generated and by this was able to ramp but had no big threats to play out against my rather aggressive questing line.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Markus O, who was in the Well for the first time, usually he plays in Hockenheim. He used a Ruby Amethyst burn deck around the new Maui Half Shark and action cards - combined with the traditional Ruby and Amethyst bounce cards. In the first game he won due to two Queen's castles from the top after two consecutive Be Prepared. In both other games I could deploy Mufasa as protection against Be Prepared and was able to just quest away.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Manuel with his Ruby Sapphire control list - which is very similar to mine using the Maui Half Shark, actions and Raya. In both games I was able to deploy my big threats and quest happily away.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |

| Manuel (Darksteel1) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/7          |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Result

Overall a good performance by the deck. Still it relies heavily on the fast Pluto Gaston line which can easily be devastated if players know what they're up against. Will see if the list can be improved even further to make new threats like Genie better handled.
