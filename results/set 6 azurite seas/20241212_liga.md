# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Card Club was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/205352. Quite a number of players showed up for this week, so it was a crowded environment.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used the Ruby Sapphire control deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/UEMLy9URz5Wa8hjEZXB2 which is the adopted list from the LCQ run I had the weekend before. Major changes are in composition around Grandma Tala and the actions. I faced Alex and his very aggressive Amber Sapphire Princess/ Ward based deck which is additionally running McDuck Manors as additional threat.

### Match 2

The second match was against the son from Pierre with his Sapphire Steel aggro deck. I opted as well for my Sapphire Steel deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/DEiyVjOvlLUtlZWf0Q6Y which is more challenge and damage based. I was able to outperform the aggressive questers with my challenges and healing options.

## Tournament Rounds

I sticked with the Sapphire Steel damage based deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/DEiyVjOvlLUtlZWf0Q6Y for the main liga tournament, as I expected a lot of Amethyst Steel or Amethyst Emerald combinations into which this deck is doing really good.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Alex N, who ran an Amethyst Sapphire blurple deck. It was a very tough matchup, as the decks overlap in some strategies, especially around the blue cards. I managed to squeeze out the 2:0 result in the overtime extra turns.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 1/2/4/7/8/10/12/14/19/20 | (x) |
| Alex (Al-ex) |      | 1/2/4/6/8/10             |     |

#### Game 2

| Player       | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 2/4/8/16/20 | (x) |
| Alex (Al-ex) | (x)  | 1/2/5/7/17  |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired against Phillip and his Ruby Amethyst bounce control deck - which is not a matchup I like to see, as the more control based character of that deck makes it hard for me - the deck usually does not challenge so often which is against my game plan.

#### Game 1

| Player                | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me                    |      | 2/4/8/10/12             |     |
| Phillip (Swordinator) | (x)  | 1/2/5/6/7/8/12/13/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player                | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me                    | (x)  | 1/4/7/10/11/16/20 | (x) |
| Phillip (Swordinator) |      | 3/5/7/9           |     |

#### Game 3

| Player                | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me                    |      | 2/3/8/12/17            |     |
| Phillip (Swordinator) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/13/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me Aleandro with the Sapphire Steel aggro deck - this was the same matchup as in the casual rounds before the tournament, so I felt pretty good and was able to get the win done. Even the second game was very close for me to win, was missing there out one round of ink due to too many uninkables on hand.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/9/14/20 | (x) |
| Aleandro (Lorigon) |      | 2/5/7/9         |     |

#### Game 2

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |

| Aleandro (Lorigon) | (x)  | 1/3/7/11/13/15/16/18/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Player             | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 2/4/9/15/19 | (x) |
| Aleandro (Lorigon) |      | 2/5/7/9/11  |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

The deck does what it's supposed to me - and it has the expected weaknesses against control based decks. So it remains to be seen how the local meta is evolving, to understand wether this is a proper pick or not. Would habe loved to play against Ole's variation of Amethyst Steel to see if that can be handled.
