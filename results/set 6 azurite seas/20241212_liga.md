# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Card Club was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/199338. It's been a while since I have been able to participate due to recent trips and other activities.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used the Ruby Amethyst burn deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/xSSbHTwfAAlu20qxsnSo which is based on the new Maui Half Shark and abuse of actions. I played against Sebastian who fielded a classic Ruby Amethyst bounce deck.

### Match 2

The second match was played in the downtime of the tournament rounds. I used the Amber Ruby Mufasa deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/XHRCG1Mqsb4FHDsmhfGz against Manuels build of Amethyst Emerald tempo. He could not get the board control going, so I could get away with high lore questing.

## Tournament Rounds

For the main liga I used a quickly assembled Amber Steel aggro list (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/AJoMjxBzchr4JsYWSGuK) which was inspired by the Brendan DeCandio and Frank Karstens lists in the LCCC (Lorcana Cross Continental Challenge) - to see if the combinations of Simba, Pluto and Rapunzel can make some work. In addition I wanted to check the recursion effect from the new Lilo card.

4 Daisy Duck - Donald's Date
4 Lilo - Escape Artist

2 Simba - Pride Protector
3 Simba - Protective Cub
2 Jafar - Tyrannical Hypnotist
4 Let the Storm Rage On
4 Strength of a Raging Fire
4 Cinderella - Ballroom Sensation
4 Lawrence - Jealous Manservant
4 Pluto - Guard Dog
3 Calhoun - Marine Sergeant
4 Ariel - Spectacular Singer
4 Sven - Reindeer Steed
4 Rapunzel - Gifted with Healing
2 Kida - Protector of Atlantis
2 Cinderella - Stouthearted
2 Pete - Games Referee

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Manuel H, who ran a Ruby Amethyst burn deck. In the two games he was able to put in some good work with his Be Prepared actions as well as with the Lady Tremaine cards. I was not able to find the Pete's needed to stop the actions in the critical moments.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 2/4/6/8/10       |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) | (x)  | 2/4/7/8/10/13/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount           | Win |

| Me               | (x)  | 2/4/6/8/10/12       |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 1/3/4/8/12/15/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

In round 2 I received the bye as we have been an uneven number of players.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Sebastian with his classic Ruby Amethyst Bounce Control deck. In the first game he was able to slam everything down, especially three Lady Tremaine cards in sequence - so there was no chance. In the second game I got full gas from the start and could deploy Pete into his turn 7 preventing the Be Prepared. My board was already wide enough and Simba secured nearly all characters. In the last game I got again pretty quickly up to lore but then he came back to get control of the board - the win was secured by Calhoun which was able to trade into a Madame Mim fox for the final two lore.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

For a deck constructed quickly it worked good. The ratios of the individual cards still need to be adjusted. Especially Pete count is to be reconsidered, as it's a crucial card in the game. Card draw is not as optimal, as it relies too heavily on the damage and Rapunzel to heal it up. The Lilo recursion effect is nice, but you need to have more than one in play - and against a heavy board it often felt wasted.
