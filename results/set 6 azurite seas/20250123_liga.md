# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

Second week into the liga of the Card Club - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/231876. Again double digit number of participants, but an even number, so Nils could not play as this would have made it an uneven number.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I played with Benjamin to further test the Emerald Sapphire Discard list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/XPMTT4sa9F5scnY3adAZ. Benjamin played an Amethyst Steel midrange deck. In the first game I could ramp and then run the discard/ bounce line as expected, while in the second game I could not find the ramp and by this lost the board control.

| Benjamin (Linlaen) | (x)  | 1/3/6/11/13/15/19/20 | (x) |

### Match 2

Second match was with Benjamin again, but I flipped my deck over to the trusty Ruby Sapphire control list with as less uninkable cards as possible https://dreamborn.ink/decks/SNqJycqw6yyA5qWBHzIM. Again in the first game I could not find any ramp and was stuck on three Be Prepareds in hand, which have been countered by repeated Pete's very efficiently. Second game was then more to plan with Maui Shark action.

### Match 3

Last casual match was against Ole who wanted to try out the Amber Steel mine deck. I opted to play Ruby Amethyst bounce in an older build against it https://dreamborn.ink/decks/W9RMUgiKReNzP6bnzmFz which still was holding up very well.

## Tournament Rounds

I wanted this week to do something else than always another variation of the Ruby Sapphire list. So I opted to use a list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/TQYZtVeiLW1Z0SAD7H6v similar to Moyen's Emerald Steel recommendation.

1 Calhoun - Marine Sergeant
4 Diablo - Devoted Herald
4 Diablo - Maleficent's Spy
2 Doc - Bold Knight
2 Hidden Cove - Tranquil Haven
4 Hypnotize
4 Let the Storm Rage On
4 Pete - Games Referee
3 Prince John - Greediest of All
4 Strength of a Raging Fire
4 Sudden Chill
3 The Muses - Proclaimers of Heroes
4 Ursula - Deceiver
4 Ursula - Deceiver of All
4 Morph - Space Goo
1 Lucifer - Cunning Cat
4 Beast - Tragic Hero
4 We Don't Talk About Bruno

### Round 1

Round 1 was against Ole, who was on the Amber Steel mine build. If the early aggression could be kept at bay and Muses are on the field it's manageable, but if this is not the case the deck is just to fast to be handled.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me        |      | 0            |     |

#### Game 3

| Ole (keo) | (x)  | 5/6/10/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired against Alex and his Amethyst Steel midrange build. Again more a result based on who won the dice roll, as his deck is build around the Amethyst evasives which are hard to handle if there is no removal found.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount              | Win |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me with Sören and again an Amber Steel mine deck. I got the first game under control with hand size control, second game was then purely in his favor and in the third game I made a mistake which cost me the game. I challenged too early into the mine and allowed him to back trade and get Rapunzel value and then out of this even a Doc draw - which allowed him to flood the board and leave me no choices anymore.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

With such a heavy steel meta the Emerald Steel Discard deck seems to have challenges, especially as boards go wide very quick.It's still a deck which requires a lot of micro decisions to be made in the proper place - and the reliance of Diablo and shift Diablo is still there.

In addition to the normal result table, I build up the matchup table, to see which matchups had been there, and which decks overcame their odds, or which decks had good matchups.
