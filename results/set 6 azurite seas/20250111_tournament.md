# JK Entertainment Jahresendevent 2024

The traditional JK Entertainment Jahresendevent is hold in January of the following year in the BÃ¼rgerhaus in Maintal. This year for the first time there was a Lorcana competition too. I participated in the Saturday event https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/226513 which had over 40 participants. It was a kind of check for me on my deck for the upcomming set championships.

## JK Entertainment Jahresendevent Meta Report

### Overall

Breakdown in inkdecks is incomplete https://inkdecks.com/lorcana-tournaments/jahresendevent-lorcana-meisterschaft-samstag-tournament-decks-1881 therefor no complete meta is possible. Manual judgement would say there had been a high participation of amber steel decks, in classic form and in mine form, as well as a typical participation of ruby sapphire decks

### Top 4

Amber Steel Aggro/ Mine

## Tournament Rounds

I used my previous deck of Ruby Sapphire control to further test it in a different environment. Compared to the last webcam tournament I added some changes https://dreamborn.ink/decks/rnUt0vRUh4LS42rzGY1s, especially around the number of Maui sharks and the Lucky Dime.

### Round 1

Round 1 pairing was directly a mirror match into David, who opted to include some interesting cards in his build. He was running on Maui's Fish Hook, Shield of Virtue and Great Stone Dragon instead of the Ice Blocks. As well he had cut the Sisu Daring Visitor in favor of Queen of Hearts. As well he was running Develop Your Brain as additional action for gaining value of Maui. Another surprise was the usage of Scar as kind of board wipe. I was starting of on the draw and in both games I was missing card draw, in the first one there was no Hiram found, in the second one then no items. Despite this I was able to battle back quite ok to keep the games close - but finally I was defeated in both games.

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Florian, who was already aware of my deck. Again I lost the dice roll and he mulliganed with his Amber Steel songs deck aggressive for the early aggression line. In both games where he was on the draw he managed to get this done efficiently and remove my options for winning. When I was on the play I could easily crush his board and his control state.

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Jenny with an interesting Ruby Amethyst bounce build. She backed up the Flynn Sisu line with Lumiere, who increases strenght on each character. As I lost the dice roll again, she was on the play two times where she could efficiently use the Flynn Sisu line. Especially in the last game I was lacking my card draw again, while she was able to develop multiple Madame Medusa and Goats.

### Round 4

After being now nearly at the end of the field with three consecutive losses it could only go upwards. Round 4 paired me into Lucy who ran an Amethyst Steel midrange build around Genie and Tinkerbell. With regards to the dice roll, it was the fourth time in a row to loose it from my side, so I started on the draw again. In both games however I was able to stabilize properly and take over the game as soon as we're in mid game.

Result after round 4: **1-3-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 paired me into Nicole on an Amethyst Sapphire blurple build with some interesting cards like Wasabi and Finders Keepers. The main threat from that deck is the ramp combined with the card draw and the ability to use Hades and Let it Go to move my characters into the inkwell. In both games I was able to control the board nicely and then play enough threats that the available answers had run out on her side. For changes it was my first win of the dice roll of the day - should stay the only one.

Result after round 5: **2-3-0**

### Round 6

Round 6 paired me into Dennis who was on a Sapphire Steel items build. I have seen his build throughout the day multiple times, as he was playing always on tables close by. As the story of the day continued, I lost my final dice roll and he could start. In the first game he was able to ramp and wheel efficiently to then utilize the Lucky Dime with Ariel and the huge number of items on his side. In games two and three I could emply shark control with multiple activations of Pirates Life to seal the games.

Result after round 6: **3-3-0**

### Result

With a good comeback to at least get even with a 3-3-0 result I was able to finish on 26th place - best 3-3-0 finisher was place 16th - but my tie breakers were simply too bad. Deck felt most times consistent despite having three games at least, where the card draw was not as expected. For sure the dice roll results added to my overall performance - but still it felt ok and I made only a very minor number of acknowledged misplays. Loosing only one game on the play as well indicates that the deck is still going strong. With the information gathered I'll attempt to make some changes to the deck for more consistency and as well more options for tackling more aggressive decks.
