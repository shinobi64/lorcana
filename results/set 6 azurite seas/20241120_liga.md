# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga

First liga event into the new set set Azurite Seas. To allow for more cards into the players hands we opted for a booster draft. https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/185592

## Casual Games

Per tradition some casual games have been played before the actual tournament to check already established/ prepared constructed decks.

### Match 1

The first match was against Greta as she wanted to check her aggro deck against my ruby sapphire control deck. As her amber amethyst deck is all on aggro it's hard to stop this from the control deck side, especially if the Sisu/ Sisu shift line is not working.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 14        |     |
| Greta (gretakatze) | (x)  | 20        | (x) |

### Match 2

The second match was then against Fiona, as she wanted to take on the aggro deck with her amber ruby Mufasa deck. She started off slow due to not finding the Pluto and Gaston cards she needs, but then she was able to take over with her large bodies.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 18        |     |
| Fiona (fionikatze) | (x)  | 20        | (x) |

### Match 3

The third casual match was with Manuel and his current take on emerald steel in a more aggressive variant than the traditional discard variant. I opted for my ruby sapphire control deck, which is interesting as it openes up some larger bodies towards Manuel to cash in on the new Go Go Tamago card.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                  | (x)  | 10        |     |
| Manuel (Darksteel1) |      | 20        | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player              | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                  | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Manuel (Darksteel1) |      | 9         |     |

## Tournament Rounds

During the draft phase I opted to pass on some higher rarity cards which do not seem to be too good in the sealed format. Instead I preferred the evasive cards and commons and uncommons with good stat lines. I think best card taken was the rare Mr. Big which is very interesting as in draft usually players opt for cards with higher strength value.

### Round 1

I go the bye assigned in the first round as we have been an uneven number of players.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round 2 I was paired with Alex, a rather recent addition to our Lorcana community. He comes from a Magic background and knows how to play cards. In both games he however had to fold against my evasive threads and the bigger statline bodies which I could put out. Mr. Big did good work, the same with the Moana 1-Drop, despite it could not attack.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/12/15/20 | (x) |
| Alex (Al-ex) |      | 1/2/4/7/8        |     |

#### Game 2

| Player       | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 1/2/3/2/6/5/9/12/11/17/20 | (x) |
| Alex (Al-ex) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/7/11              |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing into Jerry who got some good drafts out of the rounds. Especially he was able to get Simba including the shift line. However on the flip side he could not counter my evasive cards and I got as well the bigger statline cards into play before he could work against them.

#### Game 1

| Player                     | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me                         |      | 1/4/7/12/15/20    | (x) |
| Jerry (Tintenvorrat_Wooky) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/6/9/10/11 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player                     | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| -------------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                         |      | 2/6/8/12/17/20 | (x) |
| Jerry (Tintenvorrat_Wooky) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5        |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Result

With the 3-0-0 result I was able to take 1st place in the tournament, Andre C. as well went 3-0-0 but I got the better tie breakers. Tournament was fun as every time and we had a good time. Fiona played good as well, but she ventured into a location based deck - which is not really good in sealed mode.
