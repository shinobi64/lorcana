# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Draft

After a week, where I could not attend back into liga mode. This time with a chaos draft including set 2 to set 5 - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/238863.

## Casual Rounds

As there was only casual play, we tested some deck strategies in light of the last set championship weekend for the set.

### Match 1

I just pulled out my Ruby Steel Pirates deck to go against Matthias with his strength based Ruby Sapphire deck.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Matthias (Sigmea) |      | 0         |     |

## Tournament Rounds

I drafted by my usual standards, preferring evasive characters, high lore characters and strong bodies - even if they're up on the curve. As I found a small Sisu in one of the packs I as well went for two ice blocks to complement that line. Adding in two McDuck Manors nearly felt like a constructed deck. However I could not get any other removal option as none really went by me.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Matthias. His deck was way slower and could especially not deal with my evasives, so I could close out in two rather quick games.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 3/7/12/14/15/19/20 | (x) |
| Matthias (Sigmea) |      | 1/3/5/7/9/11/13/16 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/8/10/12/13/18/20 | (x) |
| Matthias (Sigmea) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7        |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me with Andre, who was able to beat Natalia in round 1. I could bring in the McDuck Manors to my advantage and by this quest faster than he could respond to my board.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me                  |      | 1/4/6/8/12/17/20 | (X) |
| Andre (andrecruz19) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/7/8/9/11 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player              | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me                  |      | 1/5/7/11/13/17/20 | (X) |
| Andre (andrecruz19) | (x)  | 1/3/5/8/9         |     |

Result after round 1: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 was then against Romwald and his collection. He seemed to have gotten all removal cards that were included in the packs plus as well the shift Cinderella, against which very little cards exist in limited - and I had none of them. I could win game one by just being more aggressive, while in game two and three he could bring out the single Cinderella each time on turn 7 - where basically the games were over after.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                         | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------------------------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/2/1/3/4/6/7/9/11/12/13/15/18/20 | (x) |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) |      | 2/5/8                             |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/7/8/6             |     |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 2/475/6/9/11/12/14/20 | (x) |

#### Game 3

Result after round 1: **2-1-0**

### Result

Was quite a good draft again - with a lot of throwback moments.
