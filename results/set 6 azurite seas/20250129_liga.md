# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

Due to issues with there was no tournament this week, but instead casual play.

## Casual Rounds

As there was only casual play, we tested some deck strategies in light of the next set championship weekend.

### Match 1

First match was with Andre and his updated Amber Steel deck to put it into a more aggressive fashion. We played two games to have a classic challenge experience. I used my Ruby Sapphire control deck to see how it fares against the aggressive setup.
