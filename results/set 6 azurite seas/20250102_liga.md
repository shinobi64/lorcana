# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

First event of the new year - weekly liga tournament in Card Club - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/219362. We had a good attendence with a total of 12 players which is a good indication for the health of the Lorcana community.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used the Amber Steel songs deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/awhj6nlC1OJeACRzHyvR which I originally constructed for Lukas on the fist games. I was playing against Aleandro, who had the same deck setup. However his draws into songs have not been as good as mine, so I was able to take both games home.

### Match 2

Andre was back in town since a long time, and he choose his Sapphire Steel deck in the no wheel version. I choose the Amethyst Emerald tempo deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/Z0UGwQ7PYFXPmkU6a423 as blind choice. The deck performed good, however Andre brought down multiple instances of the King Arthur card which allowed him to clear out some of my ready characters and deny me the lore gains. The in the long game his dime/ large Sapphire questers closed it out.

### Match 3

In the last game I played against Markus, who was first time there for the casual matches. He went with a Emerald Ruby action starter deck. I continued on the Amethyst Emerald tempo deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/Z0UGwQ7PYFXPmkU6a423 which was way more powerful than the starter deck.

## Tournament Rounds

As I assumed a lot of Amber Steel song decks I sticked with the Ruby Sapphire control deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/UEMLy9URz5Wa8hjEZXB2 for the main liga tournament. However I was under the assumption that I already made adjustments to adopt to more aggressive decks - which I made for my online variant but forgot this for the paper deck. The adoptions would have included two Queen of Hearts and one more Maui / one more Madame Medusa - especially the later one would have been great in three rounds.

4 Vision of the Future
3 Tamatoa - So Shiny!
3 Maleficent - Monstrous Dragon
4 Brawl
4 Pawpsicle
4 Hiram Flaversham - Toymaker
3 Sisu - Empowered Sibling
3 Ice Block
1 Hide Away
3 Maui - Half-Shark
1 Lucky Dime
2 Vitalisphere
2 Be Prepared
4 Sail The Azurite Sea
4 Tipo - Growing Son
3 How Far I'll Go
2 Sisu - Daring Visitor
2 Maui - Hero to All
1 Let it Go
1 Madame Medusa - The Boss
2 A Pirate's Life
4 Gramma Tala - Keeper of Ancient Stories

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Ole, who continued to run on an Amethyst Steel midrange list. This is a tricky matchup, but luckily I was able to go first which gave me a good lead. In addition I was able to find the Sisu shift line together with good draws from Flaversham. Even the second game was winable, one ink short of running the Pirates Life cycle which would have me clawing back into it.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

In round two I was paired against Chris, whom I played before only in a Neusser Store Championship. He was again on the Amethyst Emerald tempo deck, which was very close to the common list from Artabax. I was again able to go first and took the first game, second one was close again with Pirates Life. However in the third game I was faced with his perfect opening of three Merfolk followed by Banzai and Kit - there was no real way to come back from this. Unfortunately in this game my planned changes to the deck would really have helped me here.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me with Aleandro and his Amber Steel songs deck. Usually this is a favorable matchup, however again I was missing my intended changes and Aleandro drew in both games where he started the perfect lines with three Daisys each and Rapunzel at perfect times. So there was no option to get back into those games.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

Control deck choice was good, I'd two out of three favorable matches - if the adjustments would have been in place. Generally there was the expected strenght of Amber Steel songs and not many "bad" matchups for Ruby Sapphire. Let's see if this continues in the next weeks too.

In addition to the normal result table, I build up the matchup table, to see which matchups had been there, and which decks overcame their odds, or which decks had good matchups.
