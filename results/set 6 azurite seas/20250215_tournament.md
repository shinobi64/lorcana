# SÃ¼dlore Battle Bear Kaiserslautern

A very large event for Lorcana in the Battle Bear Kaiserslautern TCG store. It was organized together with the Tintenvorrat as one of the largest Lorcana communities in the DACH region. Pricing was quite interesting as the top price was a 10 rated enchanted Elsa out of set one. Due to the larger nature of the tournament there was a stacked field which included professional players like DKP or Moyen. Even Speci was there from UK to run games and stream them.Melee link https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/232439

## Tournament Rounds

I used my refined Ruby Sapphire Control list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/oyj6lK9cBQbUwTTajdPr which was setup to deal with opposing Ruby Sapphire decks and as well with Ruby Amethyst decks - as I expected quite a lot of them to be present.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Phillip out of Stuttgart and his Amethyst Steel midrange deck. It set a bit of the tone for the day, as I was later on paired quite often with the Amethyst Steel decklist. He won the dice roll and was able to get all needed card draws going in both games. So it felt like I was only a silent watcher than an active player in both games.

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Dilan and her aggressive Amber Steel list. Kind of the worst result after the round 1 loss to get directly thrown into the aggressive pool. However I was able to get game one despite being on the draw. Last game was then won by the McDuck Manor on my side.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Rico and his take on Emerald Steel. It was a list oriented on shift characters, especially legendary Belle Archer from Set 2 - which forces the player to discard it's hand once she is challenged. I was able to play around this a bit, everytime only discarding the Be Prepared while having a Shark established on the board. In the second game I could get the Lucky Dime down to close the game just in time.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me into another Amethyst Steel midrange list played by Niklas. This time I was able to win the dice roll and by that gain the needed advantage for winning my both games on the play.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                           | Win |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Vincent and his Amethyst Emerald tempo list. Despite the fact I won the dice roll, I stood no chance at all in both games, as he had all the needed pieces in hand, like multiple Merfolks, GoGo and Goats.

#### Game 1

| Player                | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me                    | (x)  | 2/6                   |     |
| Vincent (Drachenzorn) |      | 1/6/13/14/15/16/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player                | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                    | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/6            |     |
| Vincent (Drachenzorn) |      | 1/4/7/10/18/16/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 5: **3-2-0**

### Round 6

Round 6 was against Ruben, a local from Battle Bear and very experienced player and his favorite Ruby Amethyst deck. I lost the dice roll and he had the perfect start into game 1, however I somehow could get the Dime down and the Manor down and due to his lack of late draws close the game 1. In game 2 then all went more in favor to him. Game 3 was then me on the play - but I experienced the only game during the whole day where I missed my turn two ramp - despite an aggressive mulligan.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount                      | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------ | --- |
| Me           |      | 1/2/4/6/8/10/12/14/15/17/19/20 | (x) |
| Ruben (RubB) | (x)  | 1/4/5/7/9/11/13/14/16/19/17/18 |     |

#### Game 2

| Ruben (RubB) |      | 1/2/3/5/6/7/8/9/10/13/14/15/17/15/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 6: **3-3-0**

### Round 7

Round 7 was against Thomas, a player usually plaing in Biblis and his Amethyst Steel deck. I could start and take game 1, while he got his game on the play. In the last game I was missing some crucial pieces and could not establish my board good enough, while he had all the answers in his hands.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount                    | Win |

Result after round 7: **3-4-0**

### Round 8

Round 8 was against coinflip (did not got his actual name), a player usually plaing in Karlsruhe and known for Amethyst Steel and Ruby Amethyst play. It was like a replay of the previous matches against this deck - I was able to carry game 1 away, lose in game 2 and then lack card draw in game 3 - where he has the closing line of Pete into Pete in Goat in his hand.

#### Game 1

| Player     | Play | Lorecount                     | Win |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | --- |

| (coinflip) |      | 1/3/4/6/8/9/10/14             |     |

#### Game 2

| Player     | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |

#### Game 3

| Player     | Play | Lorecount                              | Win |

| (coinflip) |      | 1/2/4/6/8/9/10/11/14/16/14/15/17/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 8: **3-5-0**

### Result

It was a very long day, after wake up around 6 am, the one hour drive, eight rounds of play. There were in total two games where I felt the deck was giving up on me, while there have been a handful of play mistakes from my side. Especially against the Amethyst Steel decks I could have challenged more aggressively with my Gramma Tala. In the Ruby Amethyst game I played Be Prepared to avoid the Goat bouncing around, but as Ruben had another location in hand, which was to be assumed, I did not had the rush characters to deal with it - again something to be anticipated and rather to be played around.

Despite this the matchup ratio felt very much off - 50% of my encounters have been into one of the weakest matchups of the deck - I'd assume the overall meta share of Amethyst Steel would be less than 10%.
