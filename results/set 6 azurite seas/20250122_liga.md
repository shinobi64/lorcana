# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizards Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/223864. We're going back to constructed in order for preparation of the upcomming set championship tournaments.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

I used the newly constructed Emerald Sapphire Discard deck https://dreamborn.ink/decks/XPMTT4sa9F5scnY3adAZ to see how it can perform. I paired up with Günther who ran an Amethyst Steel midrange deck.
The games worked quite well, as I could find in both games the Bend to my Will at right spots and could close out with a drop down of McDuck Manor.

## Tournament Rounds

I could not find the courage to take up the Emerald Sapphire Discard deck for competition just yet, so I reverted back to my updated Ruby Sapphire Control list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/SNqJycqw6yyA5qWBHzIM

4 Vision of the Future
4 Maleficent - Monstrous Dragon
4 Brawl
4 Pawpsicle
4 Hiram Flaversham - Toymaker
4 Maui - Half-Shark
4 Be Prepared

2 Vitalisphere
4 Develop Your Brain
3 McDuck Manor - Scrooge's Mansion

Cards for further consideration are additional McDuck Manors or the Go the Distance song card.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Romwald with his Amethyst Steel Midrange build. As expected he could get started with an early lore gain which I could claw back using the Sharks, Pirates Life and using the control cards in my deck.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount                           | Win |

| Romawald (Dlawmore) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/8/9/10/11/13/15/13/15/13/11 |     |

#### Game 2

| Romawald (Dlawmore) | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/7/8/9/7/8/9/10/8/6 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Andre, who was on a more traditional Amber Steel songs deck. In the first game I made a mistake for not dropping more Manors for lore pressure after Be Prepared. Additionally I was not able to find a single Pirates Life to claw back the lore gain on his side.

#### Game 1

| Andre (nastra) | (x)  | 3/6/7/9/12/14/16/14      |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me Günther and his selected Amber Steel Songs deck. His build is more early on, with Daisy and Lilo to create pressure and have the insulation against Be Prepared plays. Especially in the second game he could find all pieces in time and I made a misplay to not heal my rush Maui, so he could be removed by double Let the Storm rage on.

### Result

The deck played good, especially with the Amber Steel matchups. The quick actions and consistent ramp make the deck feel less clunky. As written before there are still some flex cards which may need to be brought in.

Matchup Matrix was quite easy due to limited number of participants
