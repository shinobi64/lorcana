# Wizards Well Set Championship Shimmering Skies

It's middle of the set season, which means the set championships are up again. Third weekend of October meant a new selection of stores. This Sunday the tournament in our "home" store Wizards Well was on the schedule - tournament link https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/147819. As this kind of our home store Anni and Fiona participated as well, while Greta was just spectator - and she provided some sorting support to Lukas who acted as judge for the tournament.

## Tournament Rounds

To mix things up a bit I decided last minute for an Emerald Steel discard deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/Rpjuj0SUtmErrOOrd94g) instead of the Ruby Sapphire deck which I ran until now. The list differs a bit from the typical San Zyed list, especially Anna and Muses are cut - in favor for more shift options to be better in mid and late game against control decks.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Matthias and his Amber Steel songs deck. He was very unlucky in both games with his Arielle triggers, as he missed three times to find any song in the top four cards of his deck. Steelsong without songs is then still aggressive in questing, but lacks the board control, so I could come back from the lore difference and take both games. Especially Ursula and the discard options helped a lot to keep his hand in control and prevent Whole New World casts.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me with Andre, who ran a Ruby Amethyst bounce control deck. As well here I was able to discard him down to no cards in hand which prevented him from getting options. In addition I was able to develop in each game two Diablos while he had no access to Brawl - this meant a lot of cards and by this options for me.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Josch and his Emerald Steel discard deck. Josch was very afraid of this match, as we encountered in the nearly all tournaments which he attended in the Well - and so far the odds were in my favor. My lucky streak continued into this game, as I could generate more value from my cards in the early game and by this control the tempo. He was not able to come back in both games due to the card advantage I could generated using Diablo.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount  | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 1/2/3/7/13 | (x) |
| Josch (mrbluetosh) | (x)  | 2/4/6/11   |     |

#### Game 2

| Player             | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 1/2/3/5/8 | (x) |
| Josch (mrbluetosh) | (x)  | 1         |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 was then against Ole, as we were the only ones after three rounds with a record of 3-0-0. He offered me a draw (intentional) which I accepted as this secured the advancement into the top cut. Retrospect this did not felt right and in future I will not do any draw deals anymore but play the game instead.

Result after round 4: **3-0-1**

### Round 5

Round 5 was then against Andre D. He was right in the bubble with his 3-1-0 record and as well offered the draw. I opted again to go for it - but as stated before draw games will not be offered by me anymore in future set championships.

Result after round 4: **3-0-2**

### Top 8

After the first five rounds I ended up being 2nd on the leaderboard which gave me a good position for the top cut rounds as this gave me the opportunity to start in the first game. Top 8 round pairing was with Manuel H and his Emerald Steel deck. He was not very happy during the swiss phase as he did not got the draws he wanted. In our two games I was both times able to get shift Diablo down on turn two and then from there spiral up my card advantage. He was quite frustrated with his draws and the overall game result.

| Manuel H (Hetti89) | (x)  | 1/2/5/6/7    |     |

Result after top 8: **advance into top 4**

### Top 4

Top 4 opponent was then Manuel S who opted for an Amber Emerald hyper aggro build. In both games he got his shift Pegasus and shift Kida line into play, while I was not able to find any steel removal songs, which then meant he took away both games. In both games the Daisy did good work, as with the Emerald and Steel cards you do not have heavy hitters to counter the four willpower of Daisy.

Result after top 8: **eliminated**

## Result

I had an overall good run into this set championship - securing the promo card of Mirabel with going into the Top 8 rounds. Again it feels now not as satisfying, due to the two agreed draws - which diminishes the result a bit. Anni was this time not so satisfied with her deck, she went for a 2-3-0 record - while two games had been close, she had this time the bad end in those games. Fiona started with two close losses into the tournament but turned it then around with three consecutive wins. She finished 11th which was a very good result for her - especially as she only started the deck a day before.
