# Wizards Well Set Championship Shimmering Skies

It's middle of the set season, which means the set championships are up again. Second weekend of October meant a new selection of stores. As for last set I went to the Spielwaren Neusser in Heidelberg as this is a small shop and supporting them gives me a good feeling. Tournament link - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/148403. Orginally there had been 18 players registered but we ended up being 16 only - means we played four rounds and top cut was on four as well.

## Tournament Rounds

I went with the latest iteration of my Ruby Sapphire control deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/P0ahb8fKQlZFGYqBnWX4) which is stuffed with heavy hitters and kind of seven board wipes for different situations.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Christian who went for an Amethyst Emerald tempo deck. He got all the aggressive cards he needed against my deck and was able to open in both games with Merfolk into Banzai and with some follow up Merfolk. This speed is hard to handle, especially I could not find in both games the Be Prepared in time.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 1/2/3             |     |
| Christian |      | 2/4/8/14/16/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player    | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me        |      |              |     |
| Christian | (x)  | 2/6/11/13/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me with Torsten who was running an Ruby Amethyst bounce deck. In the first game I was able to outrun him with my lore characters, while in the second one he could get two Flynn activations and was able to close it out with the Merlin goat.

#### Game 1

| Player  | Play | Lorecount                    | Win |
| ------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | --- |
| Me      | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/6/7/8/10/12/14/20    | (x) |
| Torsten |      | 1/2/4/5/6/7/8/11/12/13/14/15 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player  | Play | Lorecount                          | Win |
| ------- | ---- | ---------------------------------- | --- |
| Me      |      | 1/3/6                              |     |
| Torsten | (x)  | 1/4/6/9/11/13/14/15/16/17/18/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-1-1**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Henrik with his Emerald Steel discard deck. In the first game we we're both in top deck mode and he managed to remove my Tamatoa otherwise it would have been game. In the second game I was able to disrupt his game play with early playing Sisu and then just quest ahead.

#### Game 1

| Player | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ------ | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me     |      | 3/6/8/9/13        |     |
| Henrik | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/7/9/13/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me     | (x)  | 1/2/3/7/8/9/11/12/20 | (x) |
| Henrik |      | 1/2/4/6              |     |

Result after round 3: **0-1-2**

### Round 4

Round 4 was against Steffen, another player with an Ruby Amethyst build. Again in the first game I could not prevent the Sisu questing, so he could close with goat. In the second game I controlled his locations early and then closed it out with three consecutive dragons.

#### Game 1

| Player | Play | Lorecount                        | Win |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------------- | --- |
| Me     | (x)  | 1/2/5/7/9                        |     |
| Henrik |      | 1/3/5/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/17/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ------ | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me     |      | 2/5/10/17/20      | (x) |
| Henrik | (x)  | 1/2/5/7/8/9/10/11 |     |

Result after round 4: **0-1-3**

With no real win it was not surprising to not make it into the top 8 players, or even the top 4. Still the deck choice felt ok, maybe for the two game format a more aggressive deck would have been better.
