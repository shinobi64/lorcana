# Spiele-Pyramide Set Championship Shimmering Skies

It's middle of the set season, which means the set championships are up again. Third weekend of October meant a new selection of stores. As for last set I went to the Spiele-Pyramide in Karlsruhe, as this has a lot of competetive players which I know from the DLCs as well as from previous set championships. Tournament link - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/153684. Orginally there had been 18 players registered but we ended up being 19 - means one player always received a bye and had some wait time.

## Tournament Rounds

I went with the latest iteration of my Ruby Sapphire control deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/IPWO3NlyglC7tHjg0Fvf) which contains some smaller rush characters to counter aggressive decks and still have the good top end cards like the Malefiz dragons.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Jan, which seems to be an all time classic. Jan is a very good competetive player and like in all our last interactions we went into a mirror game. Jan's build for Ruby Sapphire Control was more focused on dealing with Emeralds and aggressive decks - so it was not as good in the mirror and I was able to take away the win.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me with Jonas, whom I played already in the last set championships in Karlsruhe. He played an Amber Emerald discard deck which went off very good and he got the discard lines in both games where he started. Especially he was able to remove my Brawl cards to let his Diablo draw cards for free. In last game it looked very promising for me, but he was able to get Kida and Under the Sea from the top to wipe my board.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount      | Win |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Andi with his Emerald Steel discard deck. His build differs a bit from the common Zan list to include Clarabelle for additional card draw in the mid to late game. The first game was very unlucky for me, as I bricked hard around turn 4 and was not able to keep up my tempo - this allowed him to develop his board and overwhelm me.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1                |     |

| Andi (Andi1066) | (x)  | 1/3/6/8/9/13/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 was against Ruben and his Ruby Amethyst bounce control build. In both games he was able to develop a multitude of Queen's castles and Libraries - this in combination with missing card draw on my end meant a quick end to both games with no real outs on my side.

#### Game 1

| Player                | Play | Lorecount                        | Win |

| Ruben (flyingphoenix) |      | 1/3/5/7/8/11/14/15/16/17/18/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **1-3-0**

### Round 5

Round 4 was against Marco. He's a good friend of Andi and ran an Amethyst Steel aggro deck, very similar to the build I tested in the last two liga events. The deck did good work and he was able to bounce the Doc multiple times to give him enough options for card draw. In the second game he succeeded due to be able to put all four Pascals into the game - where I have limited answers in my deck, especially in the early game.

#### Game 1

| Marco (Nurephel) | (x)  | 2/4/5/6/9/10/11/12/13/14/16/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |

| Me               | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/6/7/9/10          |     |
| Marco (Nurephel) |      | 2/3/5/7/12/13/14/15/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **1-4-0**

## Result

With only one win and four losses I made place 19 out of 19 - not really unexpected given the result. The deck still felt ok, but seeing the more aggressive meta which I faced a change to include smaller Sisu would have been more beficial, as then shift Sisu could have come down on turn 6 latest instead of on turn 8 - where often against the discard decks I was only in top deck mode.
