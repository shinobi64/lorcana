Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizard's Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/147834 and based on schedule we ran constructed to test newest deck compositions.

As usual we had some casual games before the actual Liga play.

First setup was with Andre C and his Amber Ruby Locations build. I used my Ruby Sapphire Control deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/mOfLk5HsCgiTpahY3b2q) to test further for the upcomming DLC.

Game 1 Me: 2/4/6/8/11/20
Game 1 Andre (x): 1/3/6/8/10/12/14

Game 2 Me: 1/3/5/8/9/11/12/13/15/16/20
Game 2 Andre (x): 1/3/5/7/9/13/15

The control deck prevailed and showed some good responses against the more aggressive location strategy.

Second setup was against Maurice who came in from Darmstadt to play. He ran an Amber Steel Bodyguard variant and I used the Amber Steel Dwarfs deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/b9VdfO0I9WAZWa8d7NQl) as he seemed a bit more a beginner.

Game 1 Me: 2/5/10/16/19/20
Game 1 Maurice (x): 1/2/4/6

The dwarfs made good ground, capitalizing on the synergy effects of knights and dwarfs.

Third setup again with Andre C and his Amber Ruby Locations build. This time I used my Amethyst Steel Pete build (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/f6IdRqN8MLBoyMVdWAhe) as this is not fully ruled out as rougue deck.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/4/9/15/18/19/20
Game 1 Andre:

Game 2 Me: 2/1/3/5/9/12/20
Game 2 Andre (x): 2

For the liga play I used the Ruby Sapphire control deck which I intend to use for the DLC (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/mOfLk5HsCgiTpahY3b2q)

Round 1 paired me into Andre D. He ran an Amber Steel Songs list, but without Daisy as aggressive quester.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/2/3/4/5/7/9/13/14/17/20
Game 1 Andre D: 3/4/9/13

Game 2 Me: 1/4/6/10/12/20
Game 2 Andre D (x): 1/5/8/12/14

Result after round 1: 1-0-0

Round 2 paired me into Maurice. He had this rather clunky Amber Steel Bodyguards deck which lacked some card draw. Due to this he could not put up enough aggression early on to create pressure into my game play.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/3/7/13/19/20
Game 1 Maurice: 1/5

Game 2 Me: 1/2/4/5/7/8/10/14/18/20
Game 2 Maurice (x): 1/6/13

Result after round 2: 2-0-0

Round 3 paired me into Andre C. - he used his signature Amethyst Sapphire Blurple build which usually can keep up with the ramp and deploy as well larger threats. However in both games I could outramp him and as well gained significant card advantage for clear victories.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/2/3/5/8/11/13/14/16/20
Game 1 Andre C: 1

Game 2 Me (x): 2/3/4/5/7/9/14/15/17
Game 2 Andre C: 1/3/4/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/15

Result after round 3: 3-0-0

Unbeaten meant first place in this week. The store owner was observing the last game and enjoyed it a lot, as he used to play Ruby Sapphire as well.
