# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizard's Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/147881 and based on schedule we ran constructed to test newest deck compositions. Due to work related stuff there was no time to play casual games before the start of the tournament.

## Pre tournament games

I ran one game after the rounds against Andre D as he liked to test out his Amethyst Steel deck against Emerald Steel.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Matthias. He ran his trusty Amber Steel songs deck, which just had some smaller adjustments compared to the weekend set championship version. I was able to outrun him in the first game but he got the best shift top decks in the last game.

#### Game 1

| Player     | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ---------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me         |      | 2/3/4/8/9/10/13/17/20 | (x) |
| Matthias G | (x)  | 2/4/6/8/12            |     |

#### Game 2

| Player     | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me         |      | 2/3/4/6       |     |

| Player     | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me         | (x)  | 1/3/5/9/15  |     |
| Matthias G |      | 2/4/9/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Andre D. - he had setup an Amethyst Steel midrange deck around Tinkerbell and Belle. Due to his Elsa plays including bounces he could clear my board very efficiently.

#### Game 1

| Player  | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me      |      | 2/4/5/6/9/10/11/13/15/16 |     |
| Andre D | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/8/10/12/16/20    | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player  | Play | Lorecount                         | Win |
| ------- | ---- | --------------------------------- | --- |
| Me      | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/8/10/11/12/13/14/15/18/19 |     |
| Andre D |      | 2/3/6/9/13/15/20                  | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Summary

The deck was still a lot of fun, despite the results may not show it as much.
