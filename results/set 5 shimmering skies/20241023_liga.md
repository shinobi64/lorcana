# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Draft

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizards Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/147885. As we opted for some constructed games in the last weeks, we this time did a draft. It's pretty awkward to draft that late into a set, as most of the players have all their cards already together - so you can then check out some interesting builds and cards.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

In the fist game I used my Emerald Steel Hercules deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/LG5bbqa4nahdpQn1rc9j) against Manuel S with his interpretation of Emerald Steel discard. He specifically opted to not include Prince John cards in his decklist and instead put in the four drop Flynn Ryder to further capitalize on the discard strategy.

#### Game 1

| Manuel S (Darksteel1) | (x)  | 1/3       |     |

#### Game 2

| Manuel S (Darksteel1) | (x)  | 1/2         |     |

## Tournament Rounds

During the draft I got no legendary card, nor any evasive one - meant I had to focus my deck on good threats which gained a good amount of lore. My one and two drop slots had been very thin and I got a huge upside in the four drop slot. The deck rounded off with some good cards in five and higher ink drop slot.

### Round 1

The first round paired me into Patrick who seemed to have gotten all evasive cards from the draft and in addition all cards of Gathering Knowledge and Wisdom. In the first and third game he could capitalize on the evasive cards to which I could not muster any answer. Second game went more in my favor outpacing Patrick.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Manuel S who was not too happy with his draft result, as he seemed to not constrcuted a real game plan. He relied on some shift characters, especially Felix and King Candy to create speed advantage in lore gain. Finally I was able to win game two and three to secure the win.

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Anni and her draft deck which was focused a lot on early questing. In the first game she had a great start and was able to run away with it. Same happened then for me in game two and in game three I could turn the tide and then run to the finish line.

| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |

#### Game 2

| Anni (Ironlady94) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/9/11       |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

The draft was a lot of fun, chatty rounds with some thrash talk as usual. Games have been interesting seeing the different combinations of cards. MvP was the legendary steel Jafar as this got all the games for Matthias to win this weeks iteration.
