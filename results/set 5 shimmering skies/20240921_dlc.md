Lorcana Challenge Birmingham

Fourth Disney Lorcana Challenge Event - this time in Birmingham UK (https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/152670). Bimingham greated us with typical english weather - dizzle and cloudy - quite a difference to the hot Bologna one month ago. I travelled with Lukas and Michel (they both know each other since early YugiOh days) and we played some practice games during Friday. We met up as well with some friends from Karlsruhe in the pub "The Little Owl" for some food, drinks and casual games. Deck choice was around Ruby Sapphire Control setup - however some cards were still debateable, as the meta prediction was not fully clear. I ended up with the list I discussed earlier with Jan Moyen - https://dreamborn.ink/decks/mOfLk5HsCgiTpahY3b2q.

Match 1 was paired against Phillip (Germany) at table 699. Phillip is one of the mates from Karlsruhe and as we played on Friday we knew our color combinations - he was on Amber Steel Songs.

Game 1
Me (x): 1/2/3/4/5/8/11 Deckout
Opponent: 1/5/7/8/11

Game 2
Me: 1/5/11/17/20
Opponent (x): 1/3/5/7/9/12

Standings after round 1: 0-0-1
Place after round 1: 818

Match 2 was paired into Tan-Tai from UK at table 327. Tan-Tai brought as well a Ruby Sapphire Sisu based deck and so it ended up being a grindy control match with nearly no time left after the two matches.

Game 1
Me (x): 3/6/7/9/13/20
Tan-Tai: 1/3/4/5/6

Game 2
Me: 1/3/4/6/9/12
Tan-Taim: 3/6/7/8/10/14/18/20

Standings after round 2: 0-0-2
Place after round 2: 994

Match 3 was a pairing against Talim from UK at table 610. Talim put a Sapphire Steel Items deck in play. I assumed that it was based on a Whole New World refill, but this never happened. So I was glad, that I managed a claw back into both games.

Game 1
Me: 1/3/4/9/11/12/17/20
Talim (x): 2/3/5/9/14/15/17/19

Game 2
Me (x): 2/4/5/7/11/12/15/20
Talim: 2/5/8/12/13/16/18

Standings after round 3: 1-0-2
Place after round 3: 499

Match 4 was a pairing against Florian from France at table 277. Florian had an Amber Steel Songs deck which was very aggressive. In both games I was not able to get my ramp pieces down in time, as he as well interrupted my ramps very effectively. So there was no chance here.

Game 1
Me:
Florian (x): 3/6/13/20

Game 2
Me (x):
Florian: 2/4/8/15/20

Standings after round 4: 1-1-2
Place after round 4: 871

Match 5 was a pairing against Sam from UK at table 410. Sam brought in an Emerald Amethyst Tempo deck. This one is based on Clarabelles and Lyles. In the first game I was able to ramp up and bring my big characters in play - in second game I missed on those and provided as well some unneeded Clarabelle triggers.

Game 1
Me (x): 2/4/5/6/5/3/4/8/11/12/13/12/15/20
Sam: 1/4/6/7/8/10/11/13/15/16/17/19

Game 2
Me: 1/2/3/4/5
Sam (x): 2/5/7/8/10/13/14/15/17/18/19/20

Standings after round 5: 1-1-3
Place after round 5: 1028

Match 6 was a pairing into Kevin from France at table 537. Kevin had a Ruby Sapphire deck as well - with the Sapphire Mufasa included as kind of mirror breaker. Like in the first mirror we splitted the game along who was on the play.

Game 1
Me (x): 5/9/14/20
Kevin: 1/3/5

Game 2
Me: 1/2/4/6
Kevin: 1/2/4/6/9/10/14/15/16/20

Standings after round 6: 1-1-4
Place after round 6: 1053

Match 7 was a pairing into Thomas from Italy at table 546. Thomas was running Emerald Amethyst Tempo and he was abel to bring Ursula in play multiple times at the right moment to disrupt my game sufficiently enough.

Game 1
Me (x): 1/0/2/5
Thomas: 1/4/6/7/11/12/13/14/15/16/18/20

Game 2
Me: 1/3/5/6/7/8
Thomas: 2/7/8/11/13/16/20

Standings after round 7: 1-2-4
Place after round 7: 1247

Match 8 was a pairing against Jordan from UK at table 624. He fielded a Ruby Amethyst deck - but got in both games no chance against the pressure from Tamatoa and the Lucky Dime.

Game 1
Me (x): 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/17/19/20
Jordan: 1/3/4

Game 2
Me: 3/8/14/16/17/19/20
Jordan (x): 1/2/3

Standings after round 8: 2-2-4
Place after round 8: 947

Match 9 was into a Josh from UK at table 603. He played an Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck - however he was stuck in both games with limited card draw which was surprising. As a result he could not keep up with the ramp to deploy his large threats in time.

Game 1
Me: 1/2/3/6/7/9/12/13/20
Josh (x): 1/2/3/4/5/7/11/12/13

Game 2
Me (x): 1/3/4/7/8/9/12/15/18
Josh: 1/2/4/5/6/8

Standings after round 9: 3-2-4
Place after round 9: 562

With 3-2-4 it was a total of 33 points which was enough for place 562 - with equal points to place 447. Deck choice was solid, however the two losses felt unnecessary especially as it was against matchups which should be a bit more favored. I would question some specific card choices in the deck - but overall it was ok. As I scored higher than 30 points in the tournament I was eligble for 20 price tix which I converted into a promotion Rapunzel card.
