## Tournament Rounds

As I expected some more aggressive decks I decided to change my ruby sapphire list a bit and tune it to deal with more aggressive characters. At the same time I opted for the ruby sapphire deck as I expected some amber steel songs and emerald steel discard options making an appearance - into those ruby sapphire usually has a good matchup. Decklist is https://dreamborn.ink/decks/HzeNIepUDA0O6spiquXI.

### Round 1

Round one paired me directly into Anni, who ran an Amber Emerald hyper aggro list - which is based on Manuel's list from last set championship in the Wizards Well. As I knew what I had to expect I played the game more aggressive and was able to get some good combinations going, especially putting out the big Sisu helped with the board state Anni build up. In addition Anni could not get her combinations for shift lines running - making it two losses for her.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two paired me into G端nther, who was running an Amber Ruby Mufasa deck again. Compared with the last matches the list still felt the same, basically using Pluto, Gaston for ink cheating and then as well Super Goof as direct lore gain. Again this deck is very much receptive to big Sisu, as most characters initially have only two strength - and I was able to capitalize on that.

Result after round 1: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three paired me into Sebastian with an rather standard Emerald Steel discard build. In both games he got a lot of good draws, while I was stuck in game 1 on not seeing any Sisu at all, and in game two being bricked so I could not play my turn four Flaversham. So this made me being on the backfoot in both games which makes it very hard to come back against Emerald Steel.

| Sebastian (bastii) | (x)  | 2/7/13/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four was then for qualification into top 4 - as with the number of players only a top 4 was needed. I got paired into Fiona with her Amber Ruby Mufasa deck, which is build differently than the one from G端nther. In the first game all went according to plan and I got down with Tamatoa to win the game. However in game two Fiona got all the Plutos and Gastons that she needed and was by this able to get out Mickey Mouse Brave Little Tailor on turn three - which meant a 5 strength evasive character with four lore on the board. In the last game I got stuck similar like in the game against Emerald Steel which meant Fiona was able to take the game and advance into the top 4.

## Results

With a scoring of 2-2-0 I was able to secure spot 7 in the ranking which in the end meant I could get the Mirabelle promotion card. Anni was not as lucky with her matchups and she got to a 2-2-0 record as well - but as her opponents did not played so well - she only ended up on rank 9.

Greta decided for a full hyper aggro list based on Amber and Amethyst. She ended up with a 1-3-0 record and rank 13th. She was rather ok with her result, as she was able to win some individual games and the one full round. She one pairing which was very effective against the aggro setup and another one which was simply a mirror match where she lost the dice roll.

Fiona defeated me in round 4 to advance as 3rd into the top 4. In the semi final she was able to take down Andre, who was playing a Sapphire Steel items list without whole new world, advancing into the finals. There she played a local from the store on an Amber Steel songs list - while she lost there the first game, she was able to win the next two - winning the champion title and the champion mat. She was very happy with her list https://dreamborn.ink/decks/Aa8rve1NAGT4VzFQ3Qwh and especially Hydra put in a lot of work for her, so did the evasive Peter Pan.
