Card Club Hockenheim Set Championship Shimmering Skies

It's middle of the set season, which means the set championships are up again. This time their around the whole month of October on each weekend. We start up with the set championship in card club - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/146556. There originally had been 20 players registered - but due to short notice cancellations we're down to 17 players. Greta then decided to jump in as well so we're an even number of players.

I made some predictions before the weekend on how the deck distribution would be. It turned out pretty point on, with only a few deviations

I went with the latest iteration of my Ruby Sapphire control deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/P0ahb8fKQlZFGYqBnWX4) which is stuffed with heavy hitters and kind of seven board wipes for different situations.

Round 1 paired me with Anni and her version of the Sapphire Steel items deck. This deck tries to ramp as well but she was not able to find the good ramp pieces and card draw pieces, so in both games I was able to outperform her on ressources and board.

Game 1 Me: 1/2/3/4/5/7/9/12/18/20
Game 1 Anni N (x): 2/3/4/5

Game 1 Me: 2/5/6/7/8/11/12/14/17
Game 2 Anni N (x): 2/3/5/9/13

Result after round 1: 1-0-0

Round 2 paired me with Andre H who stepped away from the Amethyst Emerald deck in favor of a Ruby Sapphire list. He had played this list already in the previous set. His deck was more build around the Sisu shift line and by that was falling a bit short in this mirror match.

Game 1 Me: 1/2/4/5/8/10/13/15/20
Game 1 Andre H (x): 1/3/7/11/12

Game 2 Me: 1/3/5/8/12/19/20
Game 2 Andre H (x): 1/2/3/4/5/9/10

Result after round 2: 2-0-0

Round 3 paired me into Ole who used the Emerald Steel discard deck, very similar to the list which won the Las Vegas DLC. In all games he could establish the discard line, however I managed to draw well and got my resources established so I could answer his game line.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/13/16/20
Game 1 Ole: 1

Game 3 Me:
Game 3 Ole (x): 1/2/3/8/14/20

Game 3 Me (x): 1/3//7/8/9/11/12/14/15/17/19/20
Game 3 Ole: 2

Result after round 3: 3-0-0

Round 4 was then against Matthias as we both were kind of the few ones left with a clean west result. He played the Amber Steel songs list and got the better end in two games which were pretty close.

Game 1 Me: 1/2/3/5/8/10/12/14/20
Game 1 Matthias G (x): 1/5/8/13/18

Game 2 Me:
Game 2 Matthias G (x): 1/4/8/12/15/18/20

Game 3 Me (x): 1/2/4/5/6/8/9/10/12/13
Game 3 Matthias G: 3/6/9/13/15/17/19/20

Result after round 4: 3-1-0

Round 5 as last round of the pre rounds paired me into Phillip and his Ruby Amethyst deck. We decided to go for a draw to be safe included into the top 8 but still played the games. Indeed it went for a draw there too.

Game 1 Me: 1/2/3/5/8/10/13/17/19/20
Game 1 Phillip (x): 1/4/5/6/8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15

Game 2 Me: 2/3/6
Game 2 Phillip (x): 1/2/5/6/8/11/12/13/14/17/20

Game 3 Me (x): 1/2/4/6/7/10/13/18
Game 3 Phillip: 1/2/4/6/8

Result after round 5: 3-1-1

After the five rounds were over we went into single elimination mode for the top cut. Due to standings I was immediately paired again into Phillip. At this point he was kind of sad about the decision to go for a draw as he had then his unfavored matchup again.

Game 1 Me (x): 3/8/10/11/15/18/20
Game 1 Phillip: 1/3/4/6/8/9/11/12/13/14

Game 2 Me:
Game 2 Phillip (x): 1/2/5/6/12/15/20

Game 3 Me (x): 1/3/10/15/16/17/20
Game 3 Phillip: 1/2/4/5/6/7/8/9/11/13/15

I advanced into top 4 round

In the round of top 4 I was paired again into Andre H and his Ruby Sapphire control deck. Countrary to the earlier rounds he was able to hit back in one of the games but still was not able to manage my deck consistently.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/2/3/4/8/9/10
Game 1 Andre H: 1/4/6/9/11/17/18/20

Game 2 Me (x): 1/2/4/7/9/10/13/15/19/20
Game 2 Andre H:

Game 3 Me: 1/4/5/8/10/12/14/16/20
Game 3 Andre H (x):

I advanced into the final match

Final match was against Ole who did very well against the other competitors with the Emerald Steel discard deck. In the two games he was always outperformed by my top decks despite that his discarding was working against my hand.

Game 1 Me: 1/2/7/8/20
Game 1 Ole (x): 1

Game 2 Me: 1/3/9/13/17/20
Game 2 Ole (x): 1/2/3/7/9

It felt really good to take the win away this time - especially against good players.

Anni was happy with her result too, she was best player after the pre rounds and could secure the special promo card too. Fiona was not too happy with her deck, despite she did good and had a lot of very close games. Greta had good fun as well and was even able to win a full match against Manuel S, which made her day.

We pulled some good cards from the price boosters which complemented the successfull Saturday in the Card Club.
