Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Card Club was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/153246 and as every week it was in core constructed format.
As usual we had some casual games before the actual Liga play.

First setup was with Günther and his Emerald Sapphire Clarabelle build. I used my newly put together Emerald Steel midrange deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/4hAvb57WdC28RKC4xFkE) to see what it can do.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/3/7/10/15/19/20
Game 1 Günther: 1

Game 2 Me: 2/5/8/10/12/14/20

The midrange deck was very effective, especially using the Ursula singing Bibbi Bobbe Di onto big Tinkerbell while Chief Bogo was on board.

Second setup was against Benni - we played two games with different deck matchups. The first was with the Amber Steel Dwarfs deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/b9VdfO0I9WAZWa8d7NQl) against his latest installment of Amethyst Ruby bounce control. In that matchup the lat

Second match was with my Amethyst Steel Pete deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/f6IdRqN8MLBoyMVdWAhe) against his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple variant.

For the main liga I used the Ruby Sapphire Control list (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/mOfLk5HsCgiTpahY3b2q) as I intend to run this as well for the DLC.

Round 1 paired me into Lukas. He ran the Amethyst Emerald Tempo list with some minor adjustments to have some final test before the upcomming DLC. The matchup is pretty even and I was lucky to win the dice roll which gave me the option to start twice - as my deck is on the play a bit more favored.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/2/3/6/7/9/20
Game 1 Lukas: 1/2/3

Game 2 Me: 1/3/4
Game 2 Lukas (x): 1/4/8/9/11/12/13/15/16/17/18/20

Game 3 Me (x): 1/3/9/15/20
Game 3 Lukas: 1/3/6/10

Result after round 1: 1-0-0

Round 2 paired me into Manuel with his Sapphire Steel ramp list. His deck can ramp pretty good and he has card draw using Flavorsham, Chicha and the Whole New World. He was not able to find the last removal items/ his Tamatoa to really oppose my game.

Game 1 Me: 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/17/20
Game 1 Manuel (x): 7/8/14/16

Game 2 Me: 1/2/4/7/8/9/12/20
Game 2 Manuel (x): 2/6/8/12

Result after round 2: 2-0-0

Round 3 paired me into Matthias and his take on Amber Steel Songs. He's still running some Daisy's but backed this up with Lawrence and Naveen for better play options. As his game plan is to go wide I was relying on finding the sweepers to reset the game to my liking.

Game 1 Me: 1/2/4/5
Game 1 Matthias (x): 1/2/7/11/12/14/16/19/20

Game 2 Me (x): 3/6/9/20
Game 2 Matthias: 1/2/8/11/12

Game 3 Me: 1/2/3/7/8/12/13/16/17/20
Game 3 Matthias (x): 1/3/5/6/7/9/11/13/15

Result after round 3: 3-0-0

Unbeaten meant first place in this week. Good way to go with confidence of the deck into the challenge event.
