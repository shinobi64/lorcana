# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Wizards Well was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/147883. According to schedule we should have done Draft but as the set championship is up on Sunday we wanted to get some more test rounds for constructed in.

## Casual Rounds

Before the actual tournament rounds we played some casual games to test out some new deck strategies.

### Match 1

In the fist game I used Anni's Amethyst Emerald Tempo deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/TrrMoh0BOlbNcQ5wchkM) against Manuel H with his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck.

## Tournament Rounds

For the main liga I used the Amethyst Steel aggro list (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/lCtcyLpL1ZULPI0iKwq7) as I made some changes to the week before and wanted to see how it would fare against the casual crowds. If there would have been some more time I would have tried the Amethyst Sapphire Jafar build which I have cooking, but this is not yet ready - not even for liga play.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me into Achim, who was running a Ruby Steel build which was build around the new legendary Robin Hood from set 5 which can play out actions for free. I won the dice roll and was able to outpace him in the first game, while I missed some critical tempo cards in the other two games - which finally led to the 2-1 loss from my side.

#### Game 1

| Player | Play | Lorecount                       | Win |
| ------ | ---- | ------------------------------- | --- |
| Me     | (x)  | 1/4/7/8/11/14/15/16/17/18/19/20 | (x) |
| Achim  |      | 1/2/4/5/6                       |     |

#### Game 2

| ------ | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me     |      | 1/5/7/9/10/11/12/16 |     |
| Achim  | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/9/16/20     | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Player | Play | Lorecount                      | Win |

| Me     | (x)  | 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/14 |     |
| Achim  |      | 2/3/6/7/9/12/14/16/19/20       | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 paired me into Manuel S with his updated version of Amber Emerald Discard. Against my rather fast deck his slow questing approach proved as difficult. In addition my aggro deck runs rather low on hand cards, which contradicts his discard strategy, giving his Prince John cards not so much value. In the second game he was able to find Under The Sea which wrecked my board and secured him the win. In the last game he made a critical mistake with playing the Diablo into my Smash - bringing him early into a bad resource and board presence situation.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Santiago, who ran an Emerald Steel Robin Hood damage based deck. This is some kind of bane to an aggro deck, as especially the combination of Robin Hood archer and Robin Hoods bow card can take down characters with little willpower rather quickly. Despite he had around 30% uninkable cards in his deck he did not had issues with card draw or inking and had in both games the best cards at the best points in time - which starved me out after the midgame and gave him the wins.

#### Game 1

| Player   | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| -------- | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me       | (x)  | 2/3/5/8/9/11/12/13/14/16/17 |     |
| Santiago |      | 1/2/3/5/6/8/11/13/16/20     | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player   | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| -------- | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me       | (x)  | 2/4/6/8/9/11/12/13/14/15/16 |     |
| Santiago |      | 1/2/3/4/8/16/20             | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

The deck feels good, especially on the play - while on the draw it's often more challenging. Especially the tempo pieces like Fire the Cannons or Befuddle must be found in the starting hand/ after the mulligan to control the tempo early on. This weeks liga was won by Achim as he was able to run a much better game against Santiago than me. I'd expect he will show up with this Robin list even on the weekend for the set championship.
