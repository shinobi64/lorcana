Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga - Constructed

The weekly liga tournament in the Card Club was up again - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/165345 and as every week it was in core constructed format. Due to sickness the round was very small and not as much games as usual. Despite this we got some casual games on before the actual tournament rounds.

Game 1 was against Phillip and his Ruby Amethyst Deck. I took the Emerald Steel Discard deck(https://dreamborn.ink/decks/szZosFr5SrAqSwlKg1jB).

Game 1 Me (x): 2
Game 1 Phillip: 1/2/4/6/7/9/11/13/20

Game 2 was against Lena and her Ruby Sapphire Control deck which was build around items and the Queen. I used my Amethyst Steel Aggro build to try to speed her out (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/QZCMpZLg2b8ptoUrWFZM).

Game 1 Me (x): 2/6/8/9/10/14/15/17/20
Game 1 Lena: 1

Ruby Sapphire Control (50% conversion rate)

For the main liga I used the Ruby Sapphire Control list (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/P0ahb8fKQlZFGYqBnWX4) as I intend to run this as well for the next set championships. This list is different than the main Ruby Sapphire list, as it does not build on Sisu but Scar instead to allow for one less ink to reach.

Round 1 paired me into Lena. She ran a Ruby Sapphire control deck which is based on items like Maurice Workshop and the Queen which digs for items. That list is not so much consistent and has less threats against my bigger characters.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/2/3/4/5/8/10/12/15/18/20
Game 1 Lena: 1/4

Game 2 Me: 1/3/7/8/12/14/19/20
Game 2 Lena (x): 1/2/4/5/7

Result after round 1: 1-0-0

Round 2 paired me into Phillip with his Ruby Amethyst bounce control deck. Compared to the version he ran on the set championship he made some adjustments to eventually better deal with my Tamatoa, e.g. Be King Undisputed.

Game 1 Me (x): 1/2/3/4/6/8/11/14/16/20
Game 1 Phillip: 1/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11

Game 2 Me: 2/5/12
Game 2 Phillip (x): 1/2/5/6/7/9/13/14/15/16/17/18/20

Game 3 Me (x): 1/3/7/9/14/20
Game 3 Phillip: 1/3/6/7/10/11/13/14/15/16/17

Result after round 2: 2-0-0

As we were only three players I received a bye for round 3 and watched Lena and Phillip play it out.

Result after round 3: 3-0-0

The deck still feels very solid.
