Lorcana Challenge Birmingham Side Events

Sunday in Birmingham was time for side events - as I missed the top cut for the main event.

Contrary to Bologna I signed up for the competetive constructed event (https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/148445) as I knew the other events would not be possible due to timing of our flight back. The competetive ones are played over six rounds with two game format. As I was tired from playing Ruby Sapphire I went instead for my Amethyst Steel Pete Bounce deck (https://dreamborn.ink/decks/f6IdRqN8MLBoyMVdWAhe)

Result after round 2: 2-2-2 - rank 127

Overall 2-2-2 was not satisfying, especially the two losses against more aggressive variants from Amber Steel songs hurt - but the board went too quick too wide in both matches - and the current list does not include a board wipe song/ action anymore. With the 20 points I was eligable for some price tickets which I converted into a Cinderella card.
