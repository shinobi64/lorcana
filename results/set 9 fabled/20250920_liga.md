### Round 1

Round one pairing was into Kilian with his Amethyst Steel aggro deck. I won the dice roll and by this was able to go quick with my evasives. Second game was then bad as I could not hit any ramp and Kilian had two fire the cannons to early on remove my one drops. Last game then was a easy win.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Alex and his Amethyst Emerald evasives list. I was able to get a good start and with the number of evasives on my end I could counter his evasive onslaught.

| Alex (Randalex) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6           |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Andi and his Emerald Sapphire Clarabelle list. In the first game he had the perfect curve with multiple smaller Clarabelles into the shift with sing You're Welcome. In the second game he missed initially the ramp but then found the Pleakly and on his 6 ink turn then topdecked the small Clarabelle to immediately shift into the large one and draw endless cards as I sang Second Star to the Right just the turn before.

#### Game 1

| Me              | (x)  | 1/5          |     |
| Andi (Andi1066) |      | 2/7/11/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/6/7/8 |     |
| Andi (Andi1066) |      | 2/11/20       | (x) |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 - a good result - still the matchup into Andi's variant of Emerald Sapphire feels very tough.
