# Card Club - Fabled Set Championship

Set championship time in the Card Club. This time the event started in the afternoon - means some players opted to play earlier set championships in other locations and then had a rush to be on time. In the end the event was fully booked with 20 players attending. Event was run using the play hub - details on https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/217262. As already in past events there were players from Biblis attending, especially as they form the team 7 serpents with some local players.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Oliver - as it was the case in Speyer as well. And even in the previous liga event in the card club we had the first round pairing. As I know that he was playing the Amber Emerald aggressive dogs deck - I mulliganed hard for Benja to keep the Emerald Chromicon in check. In addition Calhoun, Dumbo and Elsa are key cards in this matchup. I started on the draw and could get my two wins in - while Oliver managed to win the second game - with a Tomago from the top.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Hannes and his Amethyst Sapphire blurple deck. I was able to get the first game on the draw, then he won the second one with a perfect line - and the last game was very close - he could stall me out with Elsa Spirit of Winter and the resolution of two Second Stars. A bit of a fortelling story for later that evening.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Rene and his Sapphire Steel midrange build. This is a tough matchup for my deck but Rene was a bit on the bricky side during the games. This seemed to have happened to him already multiple times during the day and he was a bit frustrated about this.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 1/3/4/5/6/7    |     |

#### Game 3

| Rene (Nanzu) | (x)  | 2              |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

With a 2-1-0 result after round 3 the next pairing was crucial for the ability to reach the top 8 in the end. Round 4 paired me with Denny out of Biblis and an Amethyst Steel build - which was done a bit differently and focused more on the illusion characters than on the evasive ones. It was a very close match and one of the best done during the event as it was a back and forth through all three games.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 2/3/4/5/6/7                |     |
| Denny (Demmy) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/7/9/11/12/14/17/20 | (x) |

| Denny (Demmy) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/9/10/13           |     |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

As there are no intentional draws allowed there was still the need to play out the final swiss round to secure the top 8 spot. Round 5 pairing was into Felix and his Emerald Sapphire control build. I was able to win finally a dice roll and by this I got two games more into my favor and could secure the win. Felix still made it into the top 8 due to the good tie breakers out of the match.

Result after round 5: **4-1-0**

### Top 8

With the top 8 reached the goal of securing the promo card was achieved. I was again paired into Hannes and his Amethyst Sapphire deck - and the match was a complete repeat of the swiss round. I won a game on the draw but lost my game on the play very close - again to Elsa Spirit of Winter stalling my final characters.

### Result

In the end a mixed feeling - happy with how the deck has worked, however the close defeat at the end was disappointing. The remaining decks in the top 4 would have been tough matchups as well - but as well there would have been chances to get more out of it. The list still felt very good, while the Benja cards may have been a bit of a liability given that I only encountered one aggro matchup - but in that one they have been crucial.

Anni played the Sappire Steel midrange deck - but she had a very hard day as the draws were not in her favor and she faced as well tough matchups.
