### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Lee, he ran a Ruby Steel challenger based deck, which is lacking a lot of options against evasive characters. So I could take my time and build up my board and then quest out.

#### Game 1

| ------------ | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 1/4/6/11/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Romwald and his Amethyst Sapphire Blruple deck list. I was able to run away with the game by going wide and then quest out.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Andre and his signature Amethyst Sapphire list. In both games I could not find my removal cards or my Elsa card in time to match the cards he could bring to the board.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |

| Andre (andrecruz19) |      | 4/7/11/15/16/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 - a good result. Deck felt stable in the given surroundings. If there will be more Amethyst Sapphire decks, I may play more on the Emerald Sapphire side.
