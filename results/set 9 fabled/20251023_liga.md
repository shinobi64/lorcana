## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play my Sapphire Steel midrange deck which still plays on the ally synergy but does not include Scar anymore. Instead just focus on bringing out impactful six and seven drops.

### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Oliver and his amber emerald dogs aggro deck. This deck can get a lot of lore really fast but is receptive to boards challenging it down.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 1/2/3/8/9/17/20 | (x) |
| Oliver (Kroli) | (x)  | 1/6/14/16/18/19 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me             |      | 1/7/17/20    | (x) |
| Oliver (Kroli) | (x)  | 2/5/11/15/18 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Alex and his Amethyst Steel deck. This deck is ok especially when it can go really onto the evasive track - otherwise it's hard to setup anything as the large bodies of my deck make quick business.

#### Game 1

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me                     | (x)  | 1/2/3/6/7/12/13/16/20 | (x) |
| Alexander (Randalex89) |      | 1                     |     |

#### Game 2

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                     |      | 1/2/3/5/12/20 | (x) |
| Alexander (Randalex89) | (x)  | 1/2/3         |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Patrick and his Ruby Stell challenger deck. This deck is based on challenging - which I can prevent and as well keep my characters non exerted, as they typically have the better trading stats.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/14/15/20 | (x) |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) |      | 1/3/4/5/6/7      |     |

#### Game 2

| Player               | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                   |      | 4/8/13/20 | (x) |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) | (x)  | 1/3/6     |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Result

3-0-0 and undefeated was good, matches have been rather quick and decisive. However the matchups have been mostly in my favor and especially the dogs matchup was pretty close.
