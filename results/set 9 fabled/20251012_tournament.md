## Tournament Rounds

I opted to run an Amethyst Steel build which is intended to counter the expected aggro decks - and still has some good options into the late/ control game decks like Amethyst Sapphire or Emerald Sapphire. Worst encounter would be decks using the Emerald Chromicon and the deck wants to build up the board and then challenge the opposition down.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Andre and his Amethyst Sapphire deck. I know he has opted to run some more consistency cards to let the deck run very smoothly. I was able to win the dice roll and by this could bring both games where I was on the play to a good ending for me. Especially the turn where I could bring down my Madame Mim for a Doc and then replay the Doc was a key changer.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was Fabian out of the Biblis store. Fabian was running an Amethyst Steel deck as well - however with a different selection of cards, especially around the mid cost section. I won the dice roll again and even on the game where Fabian started I could deploy more characters and then take over the board and lore gain.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Daniel from Kaiserslautern and his Amber Emerald Dogs build. He was running the Emerald Chromicon and as well Under The Sea - a combination which I have never encountered before. In both games he could utilize these cards to get board control and then bounce back my answers.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Felix and his Emerald Steel aggression deck. This deck was running multiple characters with ward and as well the Emerald Chromicon. I could however establish a proper board control and then play around the chromicon a bit.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount                       | Win |

| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 2/4/5/8/10/12     |     |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

With a 3-1-0 result after round 4 it was save to take an intentional draw in round 5 - where I was paired with Andreas and his Emerald Sapphire build. We did play for the fun and it would have been a good outcome for me - still I did not wanted to risk it.

Result after round 5: **3-1-1**

### Top 8

With 3-1-1 I was save inside the top 8 and could play the top 8 round against Matthias with his Amethyst Steel deck. I was in the higher seed after the swiss phase so I could start and win both games on the play as I could deploy there more evasive characters. The same happened for Matthias when he as won the play.

Result after round 6: **4-1-1**

### Top 4

Into the semi finals - pairing was with Max out of Kaiserslautern with his Emerald Sapphire deck. Again I was on the play - but in both games he could not get his strategy into play - as the draws he got out of his deck where not in his favor.

| Max (Maxing) | (x)  | 0                     |     |

Result after round 7: **5-1-1**

### Top 2

Final time - Daniel with his Amber Emerald Dogs deck made it into the final too. I was able to start but he got the Emerald Chromicon line and the Under the Sea line deployed again. Especially the chromicon with two Lilo - Escape Artists was a very bad combination for me. I could win the second game, but then he managed to get game three on his side. A close loss at the end.

Result after round 8: **5-2-1**

### Result

Very happy with the result - Amethyst Steel was for sure the right pick into the meta. In hindsight some item removal options would have been nice, may need to be added - as the usage of the chromicon may become more popular.
