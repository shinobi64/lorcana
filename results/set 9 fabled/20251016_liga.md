## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play my Amber Steel Tiana deck again to see how it fares. In addition I was late and wanted to have rather quicker games.

### Round 1

This was a bye for me.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Markus and his Amethyst Steel aggro deck. He won the dice roll and was able to bring too many Calhouns onto the field, so I was hard countered there. The game on the play was kind of a walk in the park with the Tiana out early.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/4/5/9/13/14           |     |
| Markus (Ohli) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/7/9/11/12/14/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |

| Markus (Ohli) | (x)  | 1/4/6/8/9/13/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Felix and his Ruby Steel singer deck. He mentioned this was a late fallback as he had not all cards for Emerald Sapphire ready.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 3/7/20    | (x) |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 0         |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 7/14/20     | (x) |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/7/8 |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 - a good result. Deck was strong as expected, despite having to play twice on the draw. Especially the match against Markus was winnable with only a bit of better top decks.
