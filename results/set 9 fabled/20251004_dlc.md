# Disney Lorcana Challenge Event Bologna 2025

It's the start of the second competetive season for Disney Lorcana. It was kicked off with the Disney Lorcana Challenge in Bologna for the EU region on October 4th to October 5th. The event took place in the same location as the previous Disney Lorcana Challenge in 2024.

As it was the first event the demand was very high and we saw players from all over the world applying for the available 2048 tickets. In the end 1864 players made their way to Bologna - which was impacted due to a general strike on Friday October 3rd which impacted all kinds of travel a lot.

The tournament was played over a total of 12 rounds of swiss followed by a top cut to 32 players. The first 8 rounds of swiss were played on the first day and all players achieving at least 18 points in the best of three format would advance to day two for swiss. The event was completely run via the Ravensburger Playhub https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/208627.

Before the tournament there was a lot of prep in the local games, as well as in my online training group. The meta was focused around a rock,paper, siccors approach with Amethyst Sapphire Blurple, Amber Steel Aggro and Amethyst Steel Aggro as the main three, accompanied by Emerald Sapphire Clarabelle. That means there are two control decks and two more aggro decks. The four decks are complemented by Amber Emerald Dogs as third aggro deck taking advantage of the slower build up of the control decks.

## Tournament Rounds

After all the testing I decided to go with an Amethyst Sapphire Blurple build - in a version which would take advantage of some cards which play well into the mirror as this deck was assumed to be the most represented one. With no clear board wipe currently in the card pool there is some dependency on the dice roll to counter aggro decks - but this was taking chances.

### Round 1

Round 1 paried me into Maxim out of France and member of team IKL. Maxim was fielding an Amber Steel aggro deck and he won the initial dice roll. I lost the first game, won the second one and established a good board to get game three onto my side - but then the kind of impossible top deck happened - a Doc into two Daisy - this gave him the game, as I had no options in hand to deal with three ready characters at the same time. This match kind of set the tone for the whole day which was determined by missing dice rolls and more than expected aggro matchups.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

In Round 2 I was paired into Berhard from Poland. He brought an Emerald Steel aggro deck utilizing the Emerald Chromicon and the Fishingline to gain maximum value on Doc. This was paired with additional aggressive questers like the new Nala. It was a tough matchup for me, which was tilted a bit in favor due to the missing card draw by Bernhard in the first game. I was kind of prepared for the play with the Chromicon by a number of games I played before against the Chromicon setup.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 20        | (x) |

| Bernhard (PL) |      | 5/8            |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 paired me into Jean from Italy. He played an Emerald Sapphire Clarabelle control deck. This is a tough matchup for me as this deck contains the board wipe combination of Heads Held High and Under the Sea. In that game it was for me important to keep my hand size low to let him gain as little value from the Clarabelle as possible and then trust on my top deck cards.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 1/3/6/7/13/19/20 | (x) |
| Jean (IT) |      | 1/3/5/7          |     |

#### Game 2

| Player    | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| --------- | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me        |      | 1/2/3/4/6/7/8/9/13/18/19/20 | (x) |
| Jean (IT) | (x)  | 3/5/7/9/11/13               |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me then into Wietse from the Netherlands. He brought in an Amethyst Steel aggro deck using special cards like the Fairy Ship for the Blurple matchups. I lost the dice roll again which put me on the backfoot from the beginning. In the third game I lost it due to a missed trigger on my Madame Mim Elefant which would have won me the game and by this the overall round. This was very unforntunate as this round decided on the win of the Mulan promo card.

#### Game 1

| Player      | Play | Lorecount                     | Win |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | --- |

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Round 5

In round 5 I was then paired with Vanquez from Spain who was playing as well an Amber Steel aggro deck. I won the dice roll and by this was able to win the two games which I could start. But it was a very tough and close matchup. Still made me to the Mulan promo card and at least moved me into the right trajectory again.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 1/4/5/13/20     | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Vanquez (ES) |      | 1/6/9/13/18 |     |

Result after round 5: **3-2-0**

### Round 6

In round 6 I was paired into the first mirror of the day. Kind of the games I really was looking for - however in the two games I really was not able to draw into something as answer of not being on the play. So despite this rather being my expected matchup I completely thrown it.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 2/4/9/10/11   |     |

#### Game 2

| Player    | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 20        | (x) |
| Raul (ES) |      | 1         |     |

#### Game 3

| Player    | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me        |      | 1/2                |     |
| Raul (ES) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/7/12/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 6: **3-3-0**

### Round 7

In round 7 I was then again paired into an Amber Steel aggro player - who was Giovanni from Italy. In both games he was able to get all the needed cards including the Doc chains to fill up his hand again. The threw me then down into the negative record side - and my only hope after this round would have been a final tie.

#### Game 1

| Giovanni (IT) |      | 2/4/13/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 7: **3-4-0**

### Round 8

Final round of day one was another pairing into the mirror. The deck was controlled by Thomas from Germany and I was able to win the dice roll - this allowed me the bring down my game plan in game one and three - to secure the win for the final tie.

#### Game 1

| Player      | Play | Lorecount | Win |

| Thomas (DE) |      | 0                      |     |

Result after round 7: **4-4-0**

### Result

With the 4-4-0 final record I was only able to get to place 729 - definitely not what I had in my mind before the event. What was very good was the meetup with all the members of my online training group during the event - and some of them have done really well and achieved the second day as well as the top cut. I'm especially proud of Phillip from the Hockenheim Community - as he reached the top 32 bracket.
