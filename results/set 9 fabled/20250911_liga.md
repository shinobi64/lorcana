### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Andi and his signature Emerald Sapphire Clarabelle list. In both games I was not fast enough, nor could I establish the Dumbo in T4 - this made me vulnerable to the specific play patterns on the other side.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 2/4/6/9/10/12/13/14 |     |
| Andi (Andi1066) |      | 1/5/6/11/15/17/20   | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/6/8/10/12 |     |
| Andi (Andi1066) |      | 2/3/6/14/20       | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Sören and his Amber Steel Reanimator deck, which tries to misuse the circle of life card to bring back expensive characters from the discard into the game.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/10/16/20 | (x) |
| Sören (Brudi) |      | 2                |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount   | Win |

| Sören (Brudi) | (x)  | 1/2/8/10/20 | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Player        | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |

| Sören (Brudi) |      | 1/3/7/8/9           |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Manuel and his Sapphire Steel Ally deck. Due to my evasives and him getting stuck bricked on six ink I could bring in the win in both games

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me               |      | 2/5/7/8/9/12/14/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (Hetti89) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6            |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/3/5/7/12/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (Hetti89) | (x)  | 1             |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 - a good result. Deck felt stable, but in the Emerald Sapphire matchups it as well felt not good at all.
