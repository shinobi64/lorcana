## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play the Amber Steel Tiana version which is teched against Amethyst Sapphire and Emerald Sapphire. Key aspects to the decklist are the one drop Aurora to play three drop Tiana earlier. Then build up some board and ideally quest out with Pluto as bodyguard in play.

### Round 1

Round one was a bye.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Andre and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple list. He won the dice roll which put me into an uphill battle position right from the start. In both games where he was on the play he had the curve with one drop into ramp into Genie into Elsa - so could effectively counter my buildup. In the game where I was on the play I had the nuts setup and was easily able to run over him.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Romwald and his Amethyst Sapphire deck. Again I lost the dice roll to put me into the harder starting position. In the first game he had it, while I had it in the second game. Last game I won due to his incorrect mulligan decisions and the attempt to overwhelm me with a number of one drops.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/3/5/7/10    |     |

#### Game 2

#### Game 3

| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5   |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 - in a small environment a good result. Still the deck is quite hard to navigate on the draw, as then some errors/ mishaps on the other side are needed to succceed.
