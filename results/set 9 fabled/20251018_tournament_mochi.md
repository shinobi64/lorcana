# Mochi - Fabled Set Championship

Set championship time in the Well. Unfortunately only 21 out of originally 30 registered persons showed up - I was going there directly from the camping ground.Event was run using the playhub - details on https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/189477. Was good to see that the player base is still mixed with participants from Biblis and Karlsruhe.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Jan - as kind of a usual first round set champs pairing. Jan was on Emerald Steel discard - a match which is pretty hard due to the fast and control options available. I was able to take game one, was kind of stomped in game 2 and could wrap game 3 then in a fast sprint with Merlin Goat in overtime.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Manuel with his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. That deck is so heavily teched to counter aggro and control matchups I could not really counter it, as I could not gain lore quick enough. On the flip side the control game is due to the better top end threats and the constant card draw in the blurple deck very hard too.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                     | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | --- |

| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 2/3/7/8/12/16/20              | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Manuel (Hetti89) | (x)  | 1/5/10/14/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Thomas and his Amethyst Sapphire deck. He included the Royal Guard next to the Belle to have even more answers for early game threats. In both games he could establish board control too early - so I had no chance to get into my own game plan.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me              |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6 |     |
| Thomas (Nexron) | (x)  | 2/5/12/12   | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1/4/6/7/8/10/11  |     |
| Thomas (Nexron) |      | 3/5/6/9/12/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Andre and his Amber Sapphire aggro deck. In both games where he was on the play he drew perfect curve plus perfect after cards, especially with four Sven cards into Alice and Wendy leaving me basically with no options to interact with his board. This game sealed it for me and I dropped afterwards with a 1-4-0 score.

#### Game 1

| Andre (andrecruz19) | (x)  | 2/4/9/11/14/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **1-4-0**

### Result

Pretty disappointed with the result, especially the heavy blurple meta which took me completely by surprise. In hind sight playing a tempo deck or a steel song may have been the better option here. I as well dropped the early for the later 2nd round of CardWings team liga - which we unfortunately lost as well.
