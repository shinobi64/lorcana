# Mochi - Fabled Set Championship

Set championship time in the Mochi Cards store. Originally this was a very crowded event, as it was scheduled for Saturday morning. Then some players switched as we ended up with 15 players. Event was run using the playhub - details on https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/189477. With the 15 players we had to play 4 rounds and top 4 only - so there was sufficient time to attend the later scheduled event in the Card Club.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to run a Ruby Amethyst Evasive deck using the singer mechanic and Second Star to the Right as main card draw engine. This is a deck which does not work well into Sapphire decks, as the main characters would then be sniped by Hades. Decklist on https://dreamborn.ink/decks/gbUZWc4UbNZfEqwhofwB

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Oliver and his Amber Emerald aggressive decks utilizing the dogs and the Emerald Chromicon. As my deck is challenge based I could take out a lot of his characters early on and then use the Pirates Life song to regain the lore in the end.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 5/9/13/20   | (x) |
| Oliver (Kroli) | (x)  | 2/5/7/12/13 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 2/5/13/20      | (x) |
| Oliver (Kroli) | (x)  | 12/14/16/14/16 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Manuel with his Sapphire Steel midrange deck. As mentioned before Sapphire decks are a bane to my deck and so it played out during the two games.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2                |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 1/2/4/7/9/13/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/3/5/7      |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 1/7/14/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Sebastian and his Amethyst Sapphire blurple deck. Again the Sapphire component was hard for me and he found two times kind of the perfect lines and did not brick on the high uninkable count in his deck - so not much to do from my side.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2              |     |
| Sebastian (SebD) |      | 2/3/6/8/10/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8 |     |
| Sebastian (SebD) |      | 3/9/11/17/20    | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Alexander and his Amethyst Sapphire deck. In the first game I had two out of my three Second Star cards in the mulligan and then drew directly into the third one. Second game was running good as I could establish the sharks and then sing multiple times Pirates Life. Last game he then had the Elsa line into my singers leaving me without comeback options.

#### Game 1

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                     | (x)  | 0         |     |
| Alexander (TopChicken) |      | 2/20      | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me                     | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/6//8/11/14/20 | (x) |
| Alexander (TopChicken) |      | 1/4/5/6/7/10/8/6      |     |

#### Game 3

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me                     |      | 2               |     |
| Alexander (TopChicken) | (x)  | 1/2/3/8/9/14/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **1-3-0**

### Result

The result was to a certain degree expected with a deck that is outside of the main lines. However facing three out of four matches the worst matchups the deck can expect was unfortunate. Especially as there have been multiple aggressive decks around into which I'd have had a good matchup.
