# Card Club - Wispers in the Well Set Championship

Set championship time in the Card Club in Hockenheim. The event was scheduled for late Saturday afternoon at 5pm which was not very comfortable for a lot of participants - so we saw some last minute drops and remained at 15 participants in the end. This was quite good, as we then only had to go for four rounds of swiss followed by a cut to top four. Detail link https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/301968 with all relevant standings.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Sebastian - a young aspiring player from the Biblis area. He usually plays Amethyst Sapphire based decks so I felt comfortable. After a few turns it became clear, that he's on the midrange variant of the Amber Amethyst deck - which works the same way but does not have the combo option. In the first game I could apply the combo - to his full surprise, as he does not seem to be aware of it at all. In the second game I could make pressure with all my other characters.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Philipp and his trusty Amethyst Steel deck. He got off to a perfect curve out in game one and then in the second game he was out of cards when I played down my Monstro with all combo cards in hand. He pulled an Elsa of the top of his deck and could clear it out and then close the game.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Oliver and his Amber Emerald aggressive dogs deck. This is a tough matchup as I'd usually have no time to deploy the Monstro combo in the game but need to stay aflot and control the board while still gaining lore. I could find in both games my Cheshire Cat to move damage back and forth to clear the board while doing questing on the same time. Especially in the second game I had both my cats boosted each with 6 cards and a third cat just slammed down to the table.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Anni and the Amber Amethyst midrange deck. As it was top cut to four we needed to play as for each of us it was not secure to get in with an intentional draw. In the first game I could deploy the Monstro combo and win on the spot - Anni was surprised, as she was not aware on the combo option. In the second game Anni could deploy more evasive characters for which I could not find answers. In the last game I had my combo prepared but Anni was able to answer Monstro directly with World's Greatest Criminal Mind. I unfortunately inked the second Monstro so I could not attempt this again - I put all my cards down and raced - but only could make it to 19 lore until end of turns in overtime.

Result after round 4: **2-1-1**

### Result

What a hard evening. I was happy with the performance of the deck - and I was even more proud of how Anni piloted the Amber Amethyst midrange deck - taking down Manuel in swiss and even giving Philipp a hard time in the top cut. Still I recognized I had too less practice with my deck to be on top of every possible play line.
