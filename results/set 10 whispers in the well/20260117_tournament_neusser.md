# Neuser Spielwaren - Wispers in the Well Set Championship

Another set championship in the Spielwaren Neusser store in Heidelberg. This is a very cosy location and with 17 players this is close to the maxmimum the store can handle. Detail link https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/320266 with all relevant standings. With the amount players participating we're up to five rounds of swiss and a top cut to the best eight. Unfortunately two players dropped after three rounds, so we still had to do top 8 cut despite being then below the threshold of 16.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to run a Ruby Amethyst deck as I expected a lot of fast and aggressive decks mixed up with some other Amethyst decks. Typically Ruby Amethyst has a good stance into more aggressive decks and an ok matchup into other Amethyst decks. Where it struggles is with Emerald Sapphire - however I only expected two persons bringing this. Decklist on https://dreamborn.ink/decks/wZh9oFu2sEI66CROuFsF

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Markus from our own team. He played his more signature Sapphire Steel midrange deck which is around the big bodies at the top of the curve. I could get started in both games quickly with a good curve out and early lore pressure followed by removal and evasive characters. Markus threw game two as he went on to a quest with a Maui Halfshark in play on my side and an action in my discard.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Johannes and the very aggressive Amethyst Emerald Inkcaster deck. This deck tries to play Inkcaster and then each turn two cards to gain lore directly by the Inkcaster in addition to all other direct lore from on play effects. In the first game he could find the needed Amethyst Chromicon to keep his hand healthy and have always access to two cards, while in both other games I could control the board and quest faster.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Marcel and his Amber Emerald songs deck. We debated a bit to do an intentional draw - but I thought I rather play - as having 2-0-1 would not be a safe way to top cut. In the first game he surprised me with an Lost in the Woods and Under the Sea combination which removed my board - but I could come back with Headless Horseman and then evasive characters. Game two was a clear path for my board with board control and especially control over his potential singers to prevent any direct impacts from the songs.

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Manuel - kind of a classic matchup. We both were the only ones with a 3-0-0 record and decided to take a tie to have a short break. Still we played two games to see how it would have gone.

| Manuel (TCR_Darksteel1) | (x)  | 1/3/5/6/10/12/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **3-0-1**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was then with Annika and her Amber Emerald Dogs deck. We both were safe for top cut and decided to take a draw.

Result after round 5: **3-0-2**

### Top 8

Top cut secured with rank two after swiss - this then made the pairing with Andre from our own team and a mirror with Ruby Amethyst. The decklists differed a bit but were mostly the same. I started on the play but he got the better draws in the first game. In the second game I could use my play advantage. In the last game again he could get the better draws, especially after he established two Cheshire Cats on the board. So unfortunately while being on the play a direct loss and by this elimination in top 8.

Result after round 6: **3-1-2**

### Result

I was happy with the deck and the performance of the deck - despite the unlucky loss in the top cut play. It was another card secured and the event was a lot of fun as always. Meta call with the deck was good and solid.
