### Round 1

First round pairing was with Andre and his trusty Ruby Amethyst deck. I won the dice roll and could easily manage to get game one for me. In the second game he could curve out perfectly and pick on my characters before I could finish my setup. In the last game I was able to play my Chromicon and he misplayed by some damage moving and by this I could slow down his questing procedure and finish by myself.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two pairing was with the Amber Sapphire detectives build from Max. As I was now aware on what this deck is doing I setup and played the Mowgli in time to remove the Spooky Sight card and then just run away with it. It's worth noting that Max was challenged with inking problems in both games.

| Max (Cantyr) | (x)  | 1/2            |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Annika and her Amber Emerald Dogs deck. She won the dice roll and build up as normal. I had the Under the Sea in my hand but could not bring enough singing power onto the board, so Annika could finish faster. In the second game I had the singer line together with the Under the Sea to establish an unchallenged lead. In the last game she played an early Chromicon and I could not find the Under the Sea - however I made two challenging mistakes which allowed her to regain the little Tramp for too much lore gain together with the little Lady.

#### Game 1

#### Game 3

| Annika (Enchannika) | (x)  | 7/10/12/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 a very solid result, especially as the deck did it's thing in nearly all games. The last match was a bit unlucky, but I recognized as well my errors - but unfortunately only after the fact. Now it's already time to move into early testing of set 11.
