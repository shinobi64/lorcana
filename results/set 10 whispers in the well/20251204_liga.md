### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Philipp and the Amber Emerald aggressive dogs deck that he's currently practicing. In both games he just could get faster to his lore gain and his key pieces. No chance to win either of these.

#### Game 1

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Felix and his Emerald Sapphire control list. In both games he could get the Prince Philipp combination out before I could establish sufficient lore control.

#### Game 1

| Felix (Varolz) |      | 6/10/20      | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Sören and his Amethyst Steel list which was build quite aggressive around evasives and the corresponding lore gain. I managed to get the song combination off in the second game, while Sören could disrupt my line again on game three.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1               |     |
| Sören (Brudi) |      | 1/2/3/5/9/14/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/3/4/13/19/20 | (x) |
| Sören (Brudi) |      | 1/2            |     |

#### Game 3

| Player        | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 8                     |     |
| Sören (Brudi) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/7/11/13/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **0-3-0**

### Result

The final result of 0-3-0 shows that the deck has an interesting idea, but is too weak and to combo dependent in the current meta line up.
