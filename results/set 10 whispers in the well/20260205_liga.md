# Card Club - Weekly Lorcana Liga

Regular liga event in the card club - compared to the last weeks it was more chill with 10 participating players. Tracking via Ravensburger Playhub https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/354469

## Casual Rounds

In the casual rounds before the actual event I played a decklist with some next set cards already proxied in. It was fun to play again with a rather decent Ruby Sapphire list that has the potential to cope with the meta decks

### Match 1

First match was with Matthias and his aggressive Amethyst Emerald burn list. In all three games I was able to cope with it - until he pulled out nearly all Gathering Knowledge and Wisdom cards at the same time. Still in the games I lost I was one turn short on my side to win the game - which is much closer than I had it with other Sapphire decks.

### Match 2

In the second match I played against Alexander with his default Amethyst Steel deck. He found two Strengh of the Raging Fire in the top 12 cards of the deck and was by this able to take out my Maui very early - a state from which I could not recover back.

## Tournament Rounds

As it was now the last event in the current set I reverted back to a deck which is rather ok to play and can take some surprises but is as well easily overwhelmed - Amber Steel aggro.

### Round 1

First round pairing was with Felix who was on Amethyst Steel instead of Emerald Sapphire to my surprise. However on the flip side he was surprised by my deck choice too. I could bring on the early aggression as well as the follow up with Tiana and Pluto to overwhelm the possible reactions by Felix. It worked in both games, while in the second game Felix tried to race and I had to break his win condition on board to force him to have another Cobra - which he did not had.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me             |      | 4/8/13/20    | (x) |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/7/12 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me             |      | 5/9/16/19/20 | (x) |
| Felix (Varolz) | (x)  | 2/4/6        |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Christian and his Ruby Amethyst deck. Typically the Ruby removal is quite strong as it's strength based and the Amber Steel list does not field too many strong characters. However again in both games he could not find and answer to my Tiana and the surrounding bodyguards.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount    | Win |

| Me                 | (x)  | 1/5/19/17/20 | (x) |
| Christian (ChrC56) |      | 2/6/12       |     |

| Me                 |      | 4/6/12/16/19/20 | (x) |
| Christian (ChrC56) | (x)  | 1/4/8/10        |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Alex and his Amethyst Steel deck - as well a matchup which can go wrong quite quick. However again I could outvalue Alex on board and create a lore pressure state that he could not answer anymore.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 3/11/20   | (x) |
| Alex (Randalex) |      | 0         |     |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me              |      | 4/13/17/18/20 | (x) |
| Alex (Randalex) | (x)  | 1/3/4/5/6/8/9 |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Result

3-0-0 was a superb result - especially as I had a quite high number of games on the draw and did not drop a single game at all. In addition I could hold four out of six hands without the need to alter. And yes, I was a bit lucky in my opponents missing out
