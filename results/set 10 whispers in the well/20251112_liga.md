# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga

First liga event in the set 10 meta for the Wizards Well. Unfortunately only five players showed up - so we went for a sealed instead of the originally planned draft. Tracking via Ravensburger Playhub https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/254630

## Casual Rounds

We tested some new deck ideas prior to the liga rounds to see how good the ideas are in the set 10 meta.

### Match 1

First match was with Manuel and his version of Amethyst Sapphire Blurple. I opted as well for my Amethyst Sapphire deck, which is running the book as card draw in combination with the item fetching Tamatoa.
