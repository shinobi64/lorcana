### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Max and his Amethyst Steel deck. I could control the game a bit, but my played You're Welcome cards pushed both times two Giant Cobra cards into his hand, with which he could finish the games where he was on start. In the game where I was on the play I could fire up the Prince Philipp combination and then take fully over the game.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Jessy and her modified Amethyst Steel starter deck. That deck lacked the draw and quest power with other Amethyst Steel decks have, so I could easily overpower the deck with my control cards in both games.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me                   |      | 3/8/10/13/20 | (x) |
| Jessy (Blacklotus34) | (x)  | 4/6/8        |     |

#### Game 2

| Player               | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me                   |      | 1/2/7/10/14/20  | (x) |
| Jessy (Blacklotus34) | (x)  | 5/9/11/12/16/17 |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Simon and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. He found no ramp and it felt his deck was not as well prepared to the Emerald Sapphire matchup and more tilted towards the Amethyst Steel matchups. I could win in both games with the Under the Sea or the Prince Philipp combination.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 2/7/14/20 | (x) |
| Simon (Stolli) |      | 1         |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me             |      | 1/3/5/6/8/13/20 | (x) |
| Simon (Stolli) | (x)  | 2               |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Anni and her Amber Amethyst midrange deck. She has with Horseman Strikes good options for countering the Prince Philipp shift. However I could overpower her with consecutive Under the Sea casts to remove the small characters and evasive characters.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 1/2/4/6/10/17/20 | (x) |
| Anni (ITFairy) |      | 2/3/4            |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount                            | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ | --- |
| Me             |      | 2/7                                  |     |
| Anni (ITFairy) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/6/7/10/12/123/14/16/17/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Player         | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me             | (x)  | 2/8/16/20 | (x) |
| Anni (ITFairy) |      | 1         |     |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

After discovering that there was a round 5 in place I was in a good spot with the 3-1-0 result. I was paired with Johannes and his Sapphire Steel aggro deck. We agreed to draw and ensure the top cut for both of us.

Result after round 5: **3-1-1**

### Top 8

Top cut secured with sixt place after swiss paired me with Andre and his Ruby Amethyst deck. This is a tough matchup as he has a lot of early lore pressure and evasive characters. the first game I lost on the draw against a line up of multiple two cost Diablos. The second game I threw away with a wrong inking decision which prevented me to fire up the board wipe when needed.

#### Game 1

| Player      | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me          |      | 2                        |     |
| Andre (AMS) | (x)  | 1/4/10/11/14/15/16/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player      | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| ----------- | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me          | (x)  | 3/6/10                      |     |
| Andre (AMS) |      | 1/4/5/8/9/10/11/13/15/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 6: **3-2-1**

### Result

I was quite happy with my performance and the deck coice. Given the situation that I constructed the deck only a day before the event it went pretty good. However it still showed that I had too less practice on the deck itself. Using the Under the Sea was a good choice given the meta - however in the general setup I find it too bricky.
