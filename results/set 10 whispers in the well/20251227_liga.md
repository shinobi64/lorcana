### Round 1

In the first round I got the bye and was able to sneak peek around what the others were playing. There was nothing out of the ordinary to be seen - most players sticked to their main deck colors.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Manuel and his Emerald Sapphire deck which is build with the detective line around Judy Hops and multiple detective characters, e.g. the Basils and as well Donald Duck. Besides this he has the typical shift lines with Clarabelle and Philipp combined with the Malicious, Mean and Scary. In the first and the third game I was able to gain lore early and have the needed answers to Philipp in hand after the turn he was played. In the second game Manuel was able to flood the board with the Judy Hops and by this generate kind of inifity card draw and lore pressure.

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Alex and his tempo based Ametyst Steel list. This contains the line with Timothy and Tinkerbell Fast Flyer. I was able to run my Demona line with good effect in game one and game three - while in game two Alex had multiple Strength of Raging Fire in hand to control the early board and run away with the game.

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Round 4

Final round pairing was with Alex H. and his Amber Emerald Dogs deck. His decklist contains Under The Sea, Emerald Chromicon, Della's Lullaby and as well The Horseman Strikes as control cards. Alex favored the Mowgli play on two to interrupt the ramp move of my deck - but in all games I was prepared for this and either had multiple non character cards in hand or no non character card. In the first game Alex was able to run his line with the multiple early drops and the follow up with the Chromicon. In game two and three I was able to control the board early and then run away with the game. However I think Alex misplayed in game three so it was easier for me to take the win.

| Alex (TopChicken) | (x)  | 2/4/10             |     |

Result after round 3: **4-0-0**

### Result

4-0-0 as final result confirms the still very strong position that Amethyst Sapphire is in - however it's still very matchup dependent and as well based on the play skill of the opponents. On the contrary I was basically each round on the draw and still could manage to gain my wins.
