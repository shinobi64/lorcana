## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play the updated version of the Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. The deck has now some more one drops to establish a stable basis for playing one drops - which is in the current meta an absolute necessity.

### Round 1

First round pairing was with Max - he surprised me with an Amber Sapphire Detectives build. However in both games he could not bring his high impact cards into play early enough, so I could run away with the game.

#### Game 1

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two pairing was with the Emerald Sapphire deck from Philipp. He was on the Fungus list from DLC Richmond. In the first game he could play the combo with all four Malicious, Mean and Scary - while not yet been even halfway through his deck. As well the Bend to my Will was very crucial rubbing me of my kept response cards. In the second game I could establish board control and prevent his singers to stay on board. In the last game I was always behind on board and again he could run the combo followed up by the Bend To My Will which rubbed me of the comeback cards which I intentionally kept.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Annika and her Amber Emerald Dogs deck. In the first game she found the perfect curve with multiple small Lady cards for shift and a Chromicon follow up. In the second game I mulliganed six cards only keeping a one drop - but I could find no ramp and found only uninkable cards - so my deck refused to cooperate at all.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                  |      | 0              |     |
| Annika (Enchannika) | (x)  | 2/4/8/12/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player              | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me                  | (x)  | 1,        |     |
| Annika (Enchannika) |      | 6/10/15   | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

1-2-0 was a tough day in the office. I faced again two unfavorable matchups and one could have easily gone either way. The last game was a full failure - which can happen but it's very rare. From the playlines I was very good with the deck - but the usage of the Demona I still need to practice.
