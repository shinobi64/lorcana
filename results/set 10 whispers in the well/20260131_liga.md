## Casual Rounds

I played with Philipp some casual rounds after the event to further check some theories on the new meta decks. We added some proxy cards to the decks to simulate the new meta.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play the updated version of the Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. The deck has now some more one drops to establish a stable basis for playing one drops - which is in the current meta an absolute necessity.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two pairing was with the Amethyst Steel deck from Philipp. This was setup much more midrange this week and it's a tough matchup. In the first game he had a perfect curve to start with. In the second game I started off with not so much card draw and found late only my one and two drops which Philipp had rather early on. At the same time Phlipp made a perfect move to hardcast Strength onto my damaged Elsa, while I had Belle in hand.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Annika and her Amber Emerald dogs deck. After the last encounter, where my deck refused to work it made a good comeback this week. In the first game I could bring out a good curve with multiple one drops and then run into Hades and take the game from there. In the second game Annika opened with Daisy's - but I could deploy two Basil's and then have multiple Into the Unknowns to stay clear of the pesky Chromicon.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount      | Win |

| Annika (Enchannika) |      | 2/6            |     |

#### Game 2

| Annika (Enchannika) | (x)  | 8/11/13/18 |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four was a pairing with Markus and his Amber Steel aggro deck. The build is around the Tiana and Daisy as well as other aggressive characters to bring the game home quickly. In the first game he ran quite quickly but I could deploy my Madame Mim Elephant to turn things around. In the second game he openend with triple Daisy, while I missed on the one drop completely - that was over quickly. In the last game again he tried to open with the Tiana line, but I had two Basil's out and could then support the Cheshire Cat and the Elephant to overcome the Tiana tax - and at the same time Markus ran out of cards.

Result after round 3: **3-1-0**

### Result

3-1-0 was a very good result - especially considering that I faced two aggro decks which are typically a very tough matchup. In addition the matchup into Philipp is always very tough and then the deck being a bit on it's weak side allows for nothing. Happy with the overall performance.
