# Mochi Cards - Wispers in the Well Set Championship

Saturday morning - the best time for a et championship in the Mochi Cards in Speyer. Originally there was a huge demand for attending this - but due to the hard winter weather break and flu season the drop rate in the last week was quite high - and 17 players remained. Details can be seen on https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/302525. With 17 players it meant we had to play five rounds of Swiss and then a top cut starting with top 8.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to run an Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck as this has a good matchup into the expected heavy Amethyst Steel meta and can survive against Emerald Sapphire too. Decklist on https://dreamborn.ink/decks/57Ln4CL3Zbuq16Tf0Gjc

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Gabriel and his Sapphire Steel midrange deck. In both games I could find my ramp and expand my board massively from there - especially dominate with the evasive characters.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/4/6/10/11/12/15/20 | (x) |
| Gabriel (Gabo91) | (x)  | 1/3                  |     |

| Gabriel (Gabo91) | (x)  | 1/2/3                |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Manuel and his Amethyst Sapphire deck. In all games the number of drawn seven cost Hades decided the game - unfortunately Manuel drew more of them. All close and interesting games.

#### Game 1

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                     | (x)  | 2/3/4               |     |
| Manuel (TCR_Darksteel) |      | 1/2/4/9/13/15/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player                 | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me                     | (x)  | 1/3/5/8/10/14/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (TCR_Darksteel) |      | 1/2              |     |

#### Game 3

| Me                     |      | 1/3/4                   |     |
| Manuel (TCR_Darksteel) | (x)  | 3/6/7/11/14/15/16/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Manuel and his Emerald Sapphire detective based deck. I could run away with the first game, while being comboed out in game two. The last game went quickly into a grind mode which Manuel could decide for him in the end.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 2/4/6/7/8/10/13/18/20 | (x) |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 1                     |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/3/5/7/8 |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) | (x)  | 1/3/6     | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Player           | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/3/5/6       |     |
| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 1/2/6/8/12/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Max and his Amethyst Steel deck. He won the dice roll so it got an uphill battle from the start. In both games where he started he found nearly all his actions and songs very early and could control the early board and then extend his board at the same time - a situation from which Amethyst Sapphire usually cannot recover. In the second game where I was on the play I could overwhelm the board quickly by using the ramp advantage. The last game went to time and we ended up in a draw during extra turns - effectively removing us both from the top cut chance.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me           |      | 2/4/6/9/10/11/16      |     |
| Max (Cantyr) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/8/12/15/16/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player       | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 1/2/6/10/14/20 | (x) |
| Max (Cantyr) |      | 1/2/3          |     |

#### Game 3

| Player       | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me           |      | 4                        |     |
| Max (Cantyr) | (x)  | 1/2/3/6/9/13/14/16/17/18 |     |

Result after round 4: **1-2-1**

### Round 5

Last round paring was with Alex and his Amethyst Steel deck. In game one I missed the ramp and by this I could not come back to the board as quickly as needed. In both other games I could establish the ramp and then effective board control.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                    | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7                |     |
| Alex (RankTheTank) |      | 1/3/4/5/7/8/9/10/15/16/18/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player             | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 1/2/5/6/7/9/20 | (x) |
| Alex (RankTheTank) |      | 1/2/3/5        |     |

#### Game 3

| Player             | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me                 |      | 1/4/5/6/10/11/15/20     | (x) |
| Alex (RankTheTank) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/8/9/10/12/14/15 |     |

Result after round 5: **2-2-1**

### Result

Deck choice was good for the meta which showed up, however matchups have been challenging and together with some misplays made it led to the missed top cut result. In hindsight the Wasabi tech was not needed and I should have played instead either additional characters or the Inkrunner item.
