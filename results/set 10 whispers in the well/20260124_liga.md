# Mochi Cards - Weekly Lorcana Liga

Regular liga event in the Mochi Card store - kind of first league event in the new year as all other weekends have been booked with the set championship events. Tracking via Ravensburger Playhub https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/321744

## Casual Rounds

I played with Philipp some casual rounds after the event to further check some theories on the planned matchups for the next online league event. We specifcially focused on the matchup with Emerald Sapphire on the play - and what decks could be setup to counter this one.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play the updated version of the Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. The deck has now some more one drops to establish a stable basis for playing one drops - which is in the current meta an absolute necessity.

### Round 1

First round pairing was with Andre and his trusty Ruby Amethyst deck. I could get off to a good start in game one despite being on the draw and playing around the Headless Horseman. In game two he simply curved out and I missed my ramp even after a full mulligan. In game three I could start out strong and then use Demona to control the board.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two pairing was with the Emerald Sapphire deck from Philipp. He was on the Fungus list from DLC Richmond. In the first game I was good on my way and presented lethal on board but had no cards left - this moment he drew the second time the Prince Philipp combo and could wipe me out. In the second game we grinded out pieces down and were very low in lore - but he was already through nearly all his win conditions and I had still plenty in my deck. In the last game he curved out perfectly into shift Clarabelle and You're Welcome and then timed the Bend to my Will perfect to remove my comeback cards that I kept. Felt a lot like Throwback Thursday.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Günther and his Amethyst Steel deck. In both games he could not curve out as expected so I could take over the board and then play my high impact characters to take the win.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount    | Win |

| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 0            |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/4/7/12/15/20 | (x) |
| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/8      |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four was a pairing with Alex H and his Sapphire Steel deck. I could in both games get the board wide to prevent him taking out my characters one by one and by this win straight away.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/3/4/5/6/9/10/15/20 | (x) |
| Alex (TopChicken) |      | 0                    |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6/10/12/14/20 | (x) |
| Alex (TopChicken) | (x)  | 1/2                     |     |

Result after round 3: **3-1-0**

### Result

3-1-0 was a very good result. I played three out of four rounds against my own team mates - and the hardest game as usual was the one against Philipp. This is a matchup which is very draw dependent if both players know what they're doing - with a favour to the Emerald Sapphire deck. It caused me again some frustration if then the combo pieces come properly from top. Besides this good games and the deck feels very solid and stable.
