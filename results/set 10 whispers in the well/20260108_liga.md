# Card Club - Weekly Lorcana Liga

First liga event in the card club - it was quite crowded with 17 players in the store. There is demand to train and test during the set championship season so kind of no suprise for it. Tracking via Ravensburger Playhub https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/328591

## Casual Rounds

Before the league event itself I played some casual rounds with Alex to train for the upcomming online league event.

### Match 1

Alex decided to use the Sapphire Steel midrange deck and I opted to take on the Amber Emerald Dogs deck. I won the dice roll and got going with it. Alex opened properly with a number of one drops but I could get around it with an Under The Sea and then just flooding the board.

### Match 2

Second match was then Alex taking up the Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. Even there I was able to go as wide as possible and then overwhelm the board and had two Chromicons deployed

### Round 1

First round pairing was with Max and his take on Amethyst Steel aggro deck with the typical line up of evasives and Demona and Hades on the top end. I lost the dice roll but could get onto a good board state in both games with hitting a proper curve and then have just board control.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two pairing was with Felix and his Emerald Sapphire deck. He had since end of last year included the Cinderella a stable and important additional ramp and filter option. The matchup is nearly unwinable for Ruby Amethyst as there is no real comeback option after the Prince Philipp combo has hit the board. And so went both games, I could go ahead but then got beaten down by either the Prince Philipp combination or a sequence of Clarabelle and You're Welcome.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Erik and his take on Emerald Sapphire. It's a similar list like Felix was running - but with some small differences e.g. with Spooky Sight. In the first game he missed the ramp and I could advance. The second game turned after the Prince Philipp combination and went then down in Erik's favor. Last game Erik ramped me with Spooky sight and then I could bring down Demona and disrupt his Prince Philipp combination.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 was a good result given the matchup matrix I faced. As I ran against two times against the worst matchup for my deck - seeing all opponents showing up with Emerald Sapphire. So the deck is positioned quite well in the meta but I profited from playing mistakes of my opponents which should be taken into consideration.
