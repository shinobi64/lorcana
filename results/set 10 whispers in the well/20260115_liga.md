# Card Club - Weekly Lorcana Liga

First liga event in the card club - it was quite crowded with 17 players in the store. There is demand to train and test during the set championship season so kind of no suprise for it. Tracking via Ravensburger Playhub https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/328592

## Casual Rounds

Before the league event itself I played some casual rounds just to check the decks and their setup.

### Match 1

I opted to play the Amber Emerald Dogs deck, and Matthias opted to play his Amethyst Emerald aggro deck. This is a quite good matchup for me, as I typically can have the faster curve and and play Under the Sea as well to clear the board and use Clarabelle to answer the items.

### Match 2

Second match was with Annika and her Amber Emerald Dogs deck. I opted to play the Ruby Amethyst deck to see how it would perform.

## Tournament Rounds

I opted to play the updated version of the Emerald Sapphire Clarabelle deck. The deck is changed to consistency and a very low number of uninkables to ensure a ramp can always be played and you can go to the higher ink amounts.

### Round 1

First round pairing was with Günter and his take on Amber Amethyst midrange. In both games I could establish my combo and the Clarabelle for consistent card draw.

#### Game 1

| Player       | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me           | (x)  | 5/10/11/14/20 | (x) |

| ------------ | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me           |      | 4/8/10/12/20 | (x) |
| Günter (GnF) | (x)  | 1            |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two pairing was with Annika and her Amber Emerald Dogs matchup. In both games she could go fast, find the Tramp wheel card and the Chromicon, which made it very hard to get into the match. As well she found in both games at the right time the Mowgli to discard my needed combo piece for the Prince Philipp wipe.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount      | Win |

| Annika (Enchannika) |      | 3/9/7/20  | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Alex and his Ruby Amethyst deck. He won the dice roll and could go in both games where he started very fast with the two cost Diablo and all other two lore quest characters. In the game where I could start I was able to super ramp up using two Cinderellas and then wipe the board and utilize Bend To My will to limit the options in Alex hand.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 3/5/8/14            |     |
| Alex (Randalex89) | (x)  | 1/4/8/9/11/12/15/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 1/6/8/13/20 | (x) |
| Alex (Randalex89) |      | 1/2/5       |     |

#### Game 3

| Player            | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2           |     |
| Alex (Randalex89) | (x)  | 1/4/8/12/16 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

1-2-0 was a tough day in the office. I faced again two unfavorable matchups which were just too fast for me to handle, especially the Ruby Amethyst matchup with only two lore questing characters. Despite the deck only running seven uninks I had the feeling that I often had some bricky hands, e.g. on turn four with two Cinderella and one Mother Knows Best.
