### Round 1

First round pairing was with Luisa and her Frozen inspired Amethyst Sapphire deck. This deck plays all the characters from Frozen but not the typical ramp actions which Amethyst Sapphire is known for. This deck is rather receptive for the removal options in my deck and so I could secure two wins.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount       | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/3/4/5/7/13/20 | (x) |
| Luisa (Luisa) |      | 1/2             |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me            |      | 2/5/11/17/20 | (x) |
| Luisa (Luisa) | (x)  | 1/4/6/8/10   |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Günther and his Amethyst Steel deck. This is a good matchup for my deck as I can push in the same amount of evasive characters and have some more/ better removal options, especially for the evasive characters. Finally the Demona did a lot of work in both games.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/3/5/6/10/20 | (x) |
| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 1/3/4/5       |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 3/10/11/18/20 | (x) |
| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6       |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Matthias and his Amethyst Steel deck. He made some changes to it so I got surprised in game one, when he pulled all the burn cards and ran away with the game. In both other games I could put in more control and get the board won for me and then quest to victory.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 0                   |     |
| Matthias (Jurki) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/12/14/15/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/4/6/8/11/17/20 | (x) |
| Matthias (Jurki) | (x)  | 2/4/5/7          |     |

#### Game 3

| Player           | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/4/8/13/20 | (x) |
| Matthias (Jurki) |      | 2/4/8/11    |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Round 4

Final round pairing was with Chris and his Amethyst Steel deck. He opted to run it a bit more midrange and with more removal included. Still the Demona plays with low cards on my hand allowing me a better value from the play.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 1/4/6/8/10/14/16/17/18/20 | (x) |
| Christian (ChrC56) |      | 2                         |     |

#### Game 2

| Player             | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me                 |      | 1/2/3/5/6/10/19/20 | (x) |
| Christian (ChrC56) | (x)  | 2/3/5//9/11        |     |

Result after round 3: **4-0-0**

### Result

4-0-0 as final result confirms the good position the Ruby Amethyst deck is in, especially in an Amethyst dominated meta.
