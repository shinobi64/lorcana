# Fancytreasure - Wispers in the Well Set Championship

Set championship time in the Fancytreasure in Biblis. Event took place on the first weekend of the year and had a good attendance - in total 24 players showed up, some of them locals and some of them came from a bit more far away. The Fancytreasure is the home base of the 7Serpents Lorcana team - so it got as usual a bit "heated" in a positive sense between us from the Illumineers and the 7Serpents. We do have a very good relationship between each other with high respect for the playing skills of the others. Detail link https://tcg.ravensburgerplay.com/events/301847 with all relevant standings. With the amount players participating we're up to five rounds of swiss and a top cut to the best eight.

## Tournament Rounds

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Lucy and her Amethyst Steel aggressive decks with a rather stock build - exception has been Pluto the Steel Champion. I could get my lanterns good into play in the first and third game. In the second game she could get more tempo on the board and could partially run away with the game.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Hannes and his Amethyst Steel deck. I lost the dice roll and he got his on the play games into an huge tempo advantage which I could not counter back. Especially not without the lanterns.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount        | Win |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Thomas and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. I won the dice roll and could get my engine rolling in game one. In game two the engine was a bit slower, but I was able to counter his evasives quite effective and by this could get both games onto my side.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount  | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ---------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1/3/7/9/20 | (x) |

| Thomas (Nexron) | (x)  | 1/2/3/5/6/7/8                  |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Manuel - kind of a classic matchup. We both thought this was the final round and a win would be for win and in. So I battled hard against his Amethyst Sapphire deck - luckily I was able to win the dice roll and start the games into my favor. In the second game he could get an overwhelming board state setup including Monstro - which I could not answer anymore.

#### Game 1

| Player                  | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ----------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |

| Manuel (TCR_Darksteel1) |      | 1/2/3                |     |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

After discovering that there was a round 5 in place I was in a good spot with the 3-1-0 result. I was paired with Jan and his Amber Emerald Dogs build. We both agreed on an intentional draw to secure the top cut for us both.

Result after round 5: **3-1-1**

### Top 8

Top cut secured with fourth place after swiss paired me with Fabian and his Amethyst Steel deck. I was on the play due to the better spot in Swiss, but in the first game I could not get my engine running after the midgame. He established with some Doc chains a pretty oppressive board state to take over the win. In the last game I made two playing mistakes which cost me the early tempo out of which I could never recover.

Result after round 6: **3-2-1**

### Result

I was quite happy with my performance and the deck coice. Given the situation that I played the deck only 20 matches before bringing it out here - the results were even more impressive. There are a few important aspects which I overlooked in three games - which costed me the games - but overall I think this was a good choice into an Amethyst dominated meta.
