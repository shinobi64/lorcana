### Round 1

First round pairing was with Philipp and the Amber Amethyst Monstro deck. In the first game Philipp made a mistake with the combo and by this lost the game. You cannot play the combo if you only have one card in hand at the beginning of the turn/ after playing the location. In the second game he was able to pull off the combo successfully - while in the third game I was able to run away with the game due to the double questers.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Second round was with Markus and his version of Sapphire Steel Midrange. He still plays the Pleakly and as well Docs in the list - together with the Jasmin shift line. However there is no Scar included to benefit off the Ally synergy. In both games I could establish a quick questing board state that was overwhelming for him to control.

| Markus (Ohli) | (x)  | 2/4/7/9/10/11       |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Manuel and his detective based Emerald Sapphire deck. The Judy Hops line allows for card draw besides the Clarabelle and the typical control options with Prince Philipp and Malicious, Mean and Scary remain. In the first game I could run away with the game, in the second game the Prince Philipp combination hit me. In the last game Manuel drew the only possible out via top deck to win him the game.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Final round pairing was with Alex and the Amethyst Emerald Aggro deck which is build around the Inkcaster and the ability to play each turn two cards to gain passive lore. As I know the deck I could find the lines to play against it - as well Alex had some weaker turns that allowed me to establish the needed board control.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/9/17/20    | (x) |
| Alex (Randalex89) | (x)  | 2/4/5/10/11/14 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 3/6/10/12/20     | (x) |
| Alex (Randalex89) | (x)  | 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/10 |     |

Result after round 3: **3-1-0**

### Result

3-1-0 as final result confirms the good position that Ruby Amethyst is in. Especially as the loss was pretty close - it could have been another 4-0-0 with the deck. The Emerald Sapphire version with the detectives feels pretty good and more stable due to the different card draw options it includes. The draw back of potentially sending back good cards from the Judy Hops plays seem neglectible.
