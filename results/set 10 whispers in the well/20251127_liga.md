### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Pierre and his Amber Emerald songs deck. This deck uses Circle of Life for reanimation from the graveyard and Tiana in combination with Under the Sea for board control. My deck was just running too fast and then the higher stated characters were important for the board control.

#### Game 1

| Me               |      | 2/5/10/13/18/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Oliver and his Amber Emerald dogs deck. He managed to get in the last game more bodies onto the board and by this could secure the final win.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Sebastian and his Amber Emerald dogs deck. In both games I managed to get better board position and by this was able to quest out faster than he could.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 1/3/5/9/14/20 | (x) |
| Sebastian (bastii) |      | 2/4/8/12      |     |

#### Game 2

| Player             | Play | Lorecount    | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Me                 |      | 2/4/11/18/20 | (x) |
| Sebastian (bastii) | (x)  | 1/2/6/10     |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Result

2-1-0 was a good result - and with all the aggressive decks in the event we're able to finish in around two hours for the three rounds. Generally happy with the deck - but it was even more important to have all the testing results.
