# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga

The first liga event in the new set started with a draft event. In total 12 players had been there. Melee details on https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/264516.

## Casual Rounds

Before and during the tournament some constructed play took place to prepare for the upcomming bigger tournaments.

### Match 1

First match was with Alex using my Ruby Sapphire item list to further test this out - especially against faster decks. Alex ran his Emerald Amethyst list - which prooved to be too fast, especially as he had in all games the double Merfolks in play.

### Match 2

In the second match I switched over my decks to the DKP inspired version of Ruby Sapphire. Especially on the play this worked out better due to the higher density of Pirate's Life songs which especially help against Amethyst decks.

### Match 3

In the third match, I sticked with my control list against Günther and his Emerald Sapphire deck including Ink Geyser and Clarabelle. It worked out ok, as I could establish board control and had more options getting back to ink and run his board over.

### Match 4

Fourth match as well with Günther and his Ink Geyser deck, but I flipped over to the item variant again. It prooved as well to be good, due to the constant draws from the workshops.

## Tournament Rounds

Drafts have been done on two different tables, then with cross pool pairings. I got quite a top heavy deck together with some sprinkles of evasive/ counter evasive cards.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Günther, he got as well some interesting cards, but could not keep up with the pace put on the board.

#### Game 1

| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10                         |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Manuel H. - he got a solid deck including Lady Kluck as tough to remove body guard. In the first and third game I could go faster and as well remove his evasive threats effectively before they did any damage. The Mother Gothel and the Amethyst Coil came in pretty handy.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Christian, he got a very good draft deck too - especially including Pascal. However I could in the second and third game deploy my answers in time - and in the last game it was the ignored Beagleboys who ensured the win due to their ability.

#### Game 1

#### Game 3

| Christian (ChrC56) | (x)  | 1/2/4/8/13/15         |     |

Result after round 2: **3-0-0**

### Result

Having a 3-0-0 record after three rounds was really good, especially as the deck did not included the big limited bombs. However the setting was good, as well due to it being the first draft in the Card Club at all and some players not yet knowing the new cards good enough.
