# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga

Regular liga event in constructed format - first time to see if the expected Sapphire Steel dominance would be present on the local liga. After some slower registration start in total 12 players showed up for the event https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/269241

## Casual Rounds

Testing time before the event. I mostly played against Günther and allowed him to choose between the variety of my prepared decks.

### Match 1

First match with Günther and his Emerald Sapphire Ink Geyser and Bend to my Will combination deck. I used the Sapphire Steel midrange build which was rather easy to pilot for a win.

### Match 3

For the third match the deck switch was over to a slower Ruby Sapphire items list. In that game Günther was able to fire off the Ink Geyser and the Bend To My Will but the item capabilties and the draw power from the workshops kept me on way to success.

### Match 4

Fourth match as well with Günther and his Ink Geyser deck and I flipped over to Amber Emerald discard using the new tramp card. I did not find the Diablo line but could early on discard his whole hand and the control the board from that point onwards.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Anni, and we immediately went into a mirror match. Anni was not fully on the item path but had as well Half Sharks in the deck, but I got in both games the better end with my items and the to close out with the Tamatoa.

#### Game 1

| Anni (Ironlady94) | (x)  | 1/4/5/6/7/8/9/11/12/14 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Fabian and his Sapphire Steel midrange build - which is very similar to my own one. Despite the fact he drew rather badly my deck was just too slow and could not establish enough draw power early on to get back into a controlling state.

#### Game 1

| Player              | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |

| Fabian (TabascoEye) | (x)  | 1/4/5/9/14/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player              | Play | Lorecount          | Win |

| Me                  | (x)  | 3                  |     |
| Fabian (TabascoEye) |      | 3/7/12/15/17/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Ole and his even more aggressive variant of Sapphire Steel. Combined with loosing the dice roll it was kind of an auto 2-0 loss here.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount                   | Win |
| --------- | ---- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Me        |      | 1/2/3                       |     |
| Ole (keo) | (x)  | 2/3/5/7/8/10/12/13/15/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player    | Play | Lorecount   | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 0           |     |
| Ole (keo) |      | 1/3/8/13/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

With a 1-2-0 it was given the matchups ok - the losses against the more aggressive Sapphire Steel builds have been expected - still it was a lot of fun to see the items jump off - or even just the aggressive opening with tool, Belle and coil. So no disappointment over the result. Games were a lot of fun and friendly.
