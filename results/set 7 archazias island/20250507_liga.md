### Round 1

Round one pairing was not given to me as I received the bye.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Nico and his Sapphire Steel aggressive list. This was going back to the Harlan Kiwi birds style. In the first game I got the good mix betwen characters and songs to keep board control established - however in the two other games he was able to run away with the use of Alice, Robins and Calhouns.

#### Game 1

| Nico (purplturtle) |      | 1/3/5/7/9/12/15/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Nico and his Amethyst Sapphire Blurple deck. This is generally a tough matchup as Amethyst has a lot of draw power which outlasts the discard abilities. In two games I could not find the songs to prevent Nico going high on quests - and the McDuck manors showed again that they're the bane of the Emerald Steel deck.

| Nico (nicoHagel) | (x)  | 2/5/7/9/11/13/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Result

1-2-0 felt hard - the played matches have been close and the deck showed my anticipated result - it can high roll pretty good, but sometimes you're being stuck without the answers and then you can't force the draws into them.
