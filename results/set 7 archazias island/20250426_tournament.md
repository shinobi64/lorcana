## Tournament Rounds

I went into the tournament with something unusal for me - an Amber Steel songs list. I had the anticipation of a high number of Ruby Amethyst decks, as well as Amber Steel decks mixed in with some more midrange style Ruby Sapphire decks. Against all of them an Amber Steel list should do ok. Especially I opted for a list with the Queen shift line to be fast and use then her ability to my advantage, e.g. to combat opposing locations. I tested the list only once before and it was ok.

### Round 1

Round one pairing was with Oskar and his Amethyst Steel Jafar Wheel build. This is based on the combination of Jafar and his ability to gain lore when you draw cards. As this is a rather single attack vector deck it was good for me to check the needed characters on his board and then use my wheels at proper moments.

### Round 2

Round two paring was with Martin and his Ruby Sapphire control list - which was infused by the DKP list. I was expecting the matchup a lot and it's one of the harder ones woth an Amber Steel list. In the fist game I could place my wheels at good times to disrupt his game plan and stay in control and close with a Pete lock. In the second game he could early remove my singers and by this put the control pieces into play and then warp it up with the shark and pirates life combination. In total a good result for me.

### Round 3

Round three pairing was with Baker - better known as LorcanaVillain. A super chill dude and he was playing his pet deck Ruby Amethyst with some spicy cards like the big Maleficent dragon. In both games I could not find my early game and in addition in game one no songs to establish control/ disrupt his game. In the second game my Daisy did some good work sending cards to the bottom but I then drew no additional pressure cards so I was closely beaten.

### Round 4

Round four paring was with Tim and by this another Ruby Amethyst matchup. In that one the first game was won by the library card draw effect, while on the second game I could run my game plan and quest to victory.

#### Game 1

Result after round 4: **1-1-2**
Place after round 4: 236

### Round 5

Round five was pairing into Brooks and his Amber Steel locations deck. I was initially surprised by the start but as soon as I saw the John Silver I knew what was going on. In the first game I made a misplay short before the end - and he could put out of five hand cards and with 5 ink then 4 location onto the mat and quest for victory. In the second game I then went into hyper control mode and cleared the board every turn - just to be safe. This draw felt like a loss, as it could be fully winable on my side.

Result after round 5: **1-1-3**
Place after round 5: 248

### Round 6

Round six pairing was with Manuel and his Amber Steel songs list. His list was more based on the Robin Hood shift line - which seemed to fair a bit worse into the mirror with my Queen list - as I could use the Queen ability in combination with Worlds Greatest Criminal Mind to my advantage. I was as well a bit more lucky with the draw of the songs, so I could take both games as win.

#### Game 1

Result after round 6: **2-1-3**
Place after round 6: 164

### Round 7

Round seven pairing then with Ruben out of the BattleBear community. I played against him during the SÃ¼dlore tournament and he was fielding again his Ruby Amethyt list. In the first game I went into hard brick mode - with four A Whole New World cards in hand after turn four. The second game I won with no issues at all. As we both were in the mix zone we decided to roll a dice for the overall win - and this one went into his favor.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 2                   |     |

| Ruben (jhonD) |      | 2              |     |

Result after round 7: **2-2-3**
Place after round 7: 226

### Round 8

Round eight pairing was with Jakob and his Amber Emerald Chernadog list. This was a very challenging match as the deck is very fast in gaining lore and it requires the right pieces on the right time to disrupt this. I got two times lucky to find the right songs even directly from the top, as he played his 2-drop Ursula with a very good timing.

#### Game 1

#### Game 2

| Jakob (PeddaPeddigrew) | (x)  | 2/4/6/11/15 |     |

Result after round 8: **3-2-3**
Place after round 8: 146

### Round 9

Round nine pairing was with Kilian from the IKO team. He was running a Ruby Amethyst list which was more tailored towards fighting with other Ruby decks. In the first game I could get my game running, while in the second game he could consistently remove my high value singers - so I could not get enough value from the songs.

#### Game 1

| Kilian (IKO_Kilzin) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/9/10/13/14/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 9: **3-2-4**
Place after round 9: 153

### Result

I felt overall good with my deck. One real game play error and the unlucky dice roll - if both would have been turned then the top cut would have been available for me. Anni played as well very good and went for a 2-2-5 result.
