### Round 1

Round one paring was with Patrick and his Amber Amethyst Hyper Aggro list. In the first game I could combat the aggressive question quite ok with Sisu and shift Sisu. In the two other games I was not able to find these lines. Game three was pretty close as he won only because he topped the action card to gain two lore to get him to twenty. Otherwise I'd have won in the next turn.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 1/2/3/6/9/12/13/14/20 | (x) |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) |      | 1/2/4/5/7/9/13/11     |     |

#### Game 2

| Player               | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                   |      | 1              |     |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) | (x)  | 1/7/9/15/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 3

| Patrick (Marzipan87) |      | 1/4/9/11/12/13/14/15/17/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Anni and her Ruby Sapphire build. She was not very happy with the recent changes she did to the deck. In both games I could get to a better card advantage point and by this overpower her in the late game.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me                | (x)  | 5/12/13/14/16/17/18/20 | (x) |
| Anni (Ironlady94) |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6/8/10/12    |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount                      | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------------ | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/0/1/2/5/6/11/19/20           | (x) |
| Anni (Ironlady94) | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/8/10/11/12/13/14/16/18 |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Nico and his more midrange variant of Sapphire Steel. He's still unhappy with the deck version as the recent bans affect this deck more than other versions.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount  | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 1/2/3/4/20 | (x) |
| Nico (NicoGräber) | (x)  | 1/4/6/8/11 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/20                | (x) |
| Nico (NicoGräber) | (x)  | 2/6/8/9/10/13/14/15 |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four pairing was with Andre and his Amber Steel songs deck. As we have practiced this before the tournament I knew this would be a hard matchup. However I was able to draw into the right pieces and by this control his deck and outvalue him in both games.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 3/6/9/11/15/18/20 | (x) |
| Andre (Putschi) |      | 1/4/7/9           |     |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me              |      | 1/5/11/20 | (x) |
| Andre (Putschi) | (x)  | 2/6/8/10  |     |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Result

3-1-0 is a good result for a local liga game. However the Ruby Sapphire list feels strong but at the same time very vulnerable against more aggressive builds. Into a more aggressive meta the Sisu and shift Sisu is absolutely needed.
