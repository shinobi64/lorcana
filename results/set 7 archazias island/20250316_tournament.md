### Round 1

Round 1 paired me Jan from the Karlsruhe community. He's a very good player and we enjoy playing against each other. He opted for a Sapphire Steel item midrange list. He got the better dice rolls and was able to play twice in starting position which secured him the 2-1 win.

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Sascha with a Ruby Steel challenger build around the new Mushu and Mulan. As there the coils from my end could do good targeting it was a rather easy win for me.

#### Game 1

| Player                  | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me                      | (x)  | 1/4/5/6/8/10/16/20 | (x) |
| Sascha (Jiminy_Cricket) |      | 1/2/3/5/7/8/11     |     |

#### Game 2

| Player                  | Play | Lorecount                    | Win |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | --- |
| Me                      |      | 1/2/5/6/7/8/9/11/12/13/15/20 | (x) |
| Sascha (Jiminy_Cricket) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/3/5                |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Matthias and his Ruby Steel challenger build. As we have discussed before the event about our builds we know what to expect from each other. Again the coils were the game changing elements as I could effectively combat his board before the challenge loop would kick off.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/2/3/5/10/11/18/20 | (x) |
| Matthias (Jurki) | (x)  | 1/2/4/6             |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me               |      | 4/5/10/11/12/16/20 | (x) |
| Matthias (Jurki) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5          |     |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me into another Sapphire Steel aggro build piloted by Sebastian. As it was pretty quick I was soon out of options to fight that deck. Especially with a double Pete and double Doc just in time he had all the pieces available when needed.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1                 |     |
| Sebastianb (S8E) | (x)  | 1/2/6/12/14/16/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 2/3                        |     |
| Sebastianb (S8E) |      | 1/2/3/5/7/9/11/12/14/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Thore and his Ruby Steel challenger deck. As in the previous games Ruby Steel is not setup yet to combat Ruby Sapphire effectively. Thore was one of a larger team from the Koblenz community.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/9/11/13/19/20 | (x) |
| Thore (Mitch13) |      | 1/3/4/6               |     |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me              |      | 1/2/5/6/7/8/12/16/18/20 | (x) |
| Thore (Mitch13) | (x)  | 1/3/7/10/12/14/12/16    |     |

Result after round 5: **3-2-0**

### Round 6

Round 6 was against Carrie out of the Koblenz community. She fielded a Sapphire Steel aggro deck too and she won the dice roll - which already kind of settled the result of the game.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount           | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --- |
| Me              |      | 0                   |     |
| Carrie (Carrie) | (x)  | 1/4/6/9/10/12/15/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1/4/6/7/8/10/12/20     | (x) |
| Carrie (Carrie) |      | 1/4/6/8/10/12/14/15/13 |     |

#### Game 3

| Player          | Play | Lorecount             | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --- |
| Me              |      | 0                     |     |
| Carrie (Carrie) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/8/10/12/14/20 | (x) |

Result after round 6: **3-3-0**

### Result

It has been a good day with a lot of exchange on the new meta developments. I was happy with my deck in general - but the Sapphire Steel aggro decks made me think on what to improve on the deck setup. Especially what can be done to get around the Alice ward package which prevents the active usage of the coil. So main question will be how much to adapt for this matchup while not loosing against the other matchups too much.
