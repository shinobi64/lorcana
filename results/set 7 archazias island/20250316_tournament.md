# Raum Zeit Labor - Turnier der Liebingsfranchises

The Raum Zeit Labor ran their fourth "fun" deck tournament with focus on the Disney franchises. Each player was challenged to bring a deck for their favorite franchise with special deck building rules. Melee link https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/258842

As part of the rules the following limitations were given

- constructed deck with minimum 60 cards
- all cards have to be of the same franchise as per Dreamborn filter
- all colors are allowed
- only 4 legendary cards in the deck
- only 8 super rare cards in the deck
- only 8 rare cards in the deck
- action, songs, items and locations have to be of the same color

With these restrictions it was challenging to build functioning decks, especially with regards to the typical topics of card draw, board control and removal.

## Tournament Rounds

After some testing I opted to play the Aladdin franchise deck, which focused mainly around the evasive cards and the new illusion cards. Choosing Aladdin I was able to bring back one of my favorite cards from set 1 - the shift Aladdin hero which does a good lore swing if he's able to bannish an opponents character. However the franchise lacks the ability to have any action/ song based removal - while at the same time card draw is very good.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me with Sören and his Beauty and the Beast deck. Especially the legendary Beast provided him a good card draw support. He surprised me in game one with a combination of the sing together Mob Song followed up by Grab Your Sword. In the end I was able to close the game out with the Giant Cobra and the ability to discard a card to instant gain two lore.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Günther and his Mickey and Friends deck. I guess he had choosen this to continue to play Clarabelle for card draw. Besides this there are a lot of Mickey characters which come with body guard ability. In addition there is for sure the Super Goof to have the option for instant lore gain. I was able to combat this with a combination of illusions and the Jafar plus my evasive characters.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Jerry and his Mulan themed deck. Jerry was doing some last minute adjustments on his deck, as based on his previous version there were too many rare cards included. To combat evasive characters he relied on the Imperial Bow which as well opened up the way to use Avalanche as broad based damage action. In both games I was able to play around the shift Mulan option and around Mushu - especially keeping my evasives not exerted and not offering up unfavorable trades.

#### Game 1

| Player                     | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |

#### Game 2

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me into Ole and his version of Sleeping Beauty. This franchise has access to two powerful cards - legendary Diablo for card draw and Dragon Fire as unconditional spot removal. These have been the two games where I could not find my evasive characters early on - and by this Ole was able to running away with the card draw and ressources.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me        |      | 5         |     |
| Ole (keo) | (x)  | 20        | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player    | Play | Lorecount | Win |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 12        |     |
| Ole (keo) |      | 20        | (x) |

Result after round 4: **3-1-0**

### Round 5

Round 5 was then against Markus and his Vaiana deck. He emphasized the Hei Hei characters, especially the one which goes back to hand after being banished in a challenge - a nice recursion option to keep the hand filled. However I could outrun him with my illusions and the evasive characters.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |

Result after round 5: **4-1-0**

### Result

For sure a very fun tournament, given the deck building restrictions a lot of cards have seen play, which are otherwise not that present in the regular tournaments/ meta. The choice of Aladdin was a good one - as the deck could perform really good given the rather consistent card draw and the good stattet characters which allowed efficient trades. The lack of removal was a bit challenging for my own playstyle - but acceptable, as nearly all other decks had to deal with the same kind of issue.

Greta, Fiona and Anni participated as well in the event and we all had a lot of fun, even Greta where the Robin Hood deck was not running as smoothly as she anticipated.
