# Card Club Hockenheim - Archazia's Island Release Event

New set is on the steps of the release on March 7th. As usual the Card Club went for a midnight release event https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/236238. This release event was packed with more than 30 players.

## Tournament Rounds

My sealed pool was rather average, no legendary cards and just a single evasive card. Especially the more "broken" cards in sealed were not found. Despite this I put together a good curve out deck.

### Round 1

Round one was against Patrick, who was able to pull the legendary Donald and as well some evasive cards. I was able to play around this a bit and finally get the win down for me.

#### Game 1

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was against Sören, who had a bye in the first round. His deck did not curve out as mine and by this I was able to secure two rather fast wins.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount         | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/5/8/11/12/16/20 | (x) |
| Sören (Brudi) |      | 1/2/3/5/6         |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                    | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 1/2/5/6/7/8/9/13/14/16/18/20 | (x) |
| Sören (Brudi) | (x)  | 1/4/5/8/10/11/14/13/15       |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three paired me into Steffen who had a pretty nuts pool consisting of Snow White, Pascal, Diablo and Figet. In the first game I was able to counter it, but in the two other games it was mainly just watching and letting him play - without having answers to the evasive threats.

#### Game 1

| Player                   | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Me                       | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/6/8/9/13/14/17/20 | (x) |
| Steffen (SteffenStadler) |      | 1/3/8/9                   |     |

#### Game 2

| Player                   | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me                       |      | 1/2/6/7/8              |     |
| Steffen (SteffenStadler) | (x)  | 1/2/5/8/11/10/13/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four paired me into Andre - a typical matchup. He as well had a similar pool like Steffen, so there was no chance for me in either of the games.

#### Game 1

| Player          | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me              |      | 1/4/10/12          |     |
| Andre (Putschi) | (x)  | 1/2/4/8/9/11/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player          | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me              | (x)  | 1/2/4/7/10/15           |     |
| Andre (Putschi) |      | 1/2/4/6/7/9/13/14/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 3: **2-2-0**

### Result

Overall a lot of excitement on the new cards. Some cards are fully broken in sealed/ limited and make it very imbalanced. Still we had some good pulls as a family and enjoyed our games.
