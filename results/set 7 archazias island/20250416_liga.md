### Round 1

Round one paring was with Noel and his Ruby Amethyst burn deck. In both games he could not get fast enough to the finish line before my control pieces could take over the game.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Nico and his Amethyst Steel aggressive deck. He was able to close out the first game a bit too fast, while in the other two I could control fast enough.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Achim and his Amber Emerald Chernadog deck. By incident we have chatted before the games on what deck would be best in a Ruby Sapphire meta and then I threw a dice and the result was the Amber Emerald Chernadog deck. In the last game I could have turned it around, but I could not find an answer to the last Merfolk Achim slammed down. Sisu and shift Sisu had been pretty instrumental in the games for me.

Result after round 3: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four pairing was with Romwald and his updated Ruby Sapphire control deck. He build around the new character which draws out of items, combined with Lady Tremaines for board control. It was a little bit unlucky - as I was one turn away to win the game three and avoid a draw. But it's like it is in control mirror matches.

Result after round 4: **2-1-1**

### Result

With 2-1-1 and a good tie breaker I was able to take 3rd place. I could have gone up to second with winning the last game, but it was still a fun round with lot's of interesting side talks. Deck feels good with lot's of options - however I did not test into a location heavy build/ location heavy control setup like the DKP fashioned Ruby Sapphire list.
