### Match 4

Fourth match was just to wind down, while Anni and Arpan were still playing the Blood Bowl league event. I played with Patrick and he opted for a Amber Emerald discard deck, while I choose the Amber Emerald chernadog deck.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Patrick and his Amethyst Steel aggro list. I could establish in the first and third game early board control which allowed me to advance, while in the second game he could drop down all the pieces to the board and use the lore gain cards to quickly close out the game.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Manuel and his incarnation of Amethyst Emerald Discard. He was able to put the Diablos in at better times and my top decks were worse than his.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Andre H and his Ruby Amethyst deck. First game I did not draw any good cards at all, while in the second game my discard worked but mid game he came back with good top deck followed by good top deck.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/8/9/10       |     |
| Andre H (nastra) |      | 2/4/7/11/14/15/16/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                  | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/6/7/11/12          |     |
| Andre H (nastra) |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6/11/13/15/16/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

With 3-1-0 and a good tie breaker it meant second place - only behind Andre (my only loss). Deck felt good and stable, even able to deal with aggressive counter decks. Variance is expected and especially hit in the Ruby Amethyst games. Learning is to be a bit more cautious with the draws to not get too greedy - especially against wheel based decks.
