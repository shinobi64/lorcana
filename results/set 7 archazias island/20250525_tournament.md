# Mochi Cards Speyer - Archazias Island Set Championship

Last event for me in the set championship season. Mochi cards in Speyer is a smaller Lorcana community shop and due to this we only had around 10 participants present. As the shop is quite new they rather want to go for the new Ravensbuger Play Hub instead of still applying for Melee.

## Tournament Rounds

I wanted to do something different this time and went for the Amethyst Steel Jafar deck. Before the event I fuddled around with an Amethyst Sapphire variant but expected some aggro where I thought the steel variant would allow me more control options. Decklist is https://dreamborn.ink/decks/XFuxkY7iXEJJv68ivOqX which included the six cost Jafar which is a good counter for aggro decks and can counter Rapunzel traps pretty good.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me Markus and his Amber Steel aggro list. In the first game I had a hard brick around turn three - due to which I had to play an early Whole New World which filled up his hand pretty good. Due to this I could not bring enough bodies onto the field to counter his aggressive questers. In the second game I could get the setup better in play and had it all under control. In the third game I could not find a one or two drop - so this already sealed the fate for the overall match. Especially after the mulligan I had all four seven drop Jafar cards in my hand.

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Sören and his Amber Steel songs deck. I could play properly in the first game, while in the second and third game he had the perfect combination of characters and songs, especially in the third game he could get all songs from the top that he needed to handle my board state.

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Günther and his Amber Steel song variant. In both games where I started I could establish early on board control and cruise to victory. In the game where Günther started he could shift early and by this setup his game plan properly.

Result after round 3: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Jan Matthias and his Sapphire Steel aggro list. I could start up with a good board state and bounce his cards early on using Genie and the Lamp. He could not come back from the tempo loss caused by this. In the second game I managed to win with the Jafar Wheel combination - this felt very good as closure of the event.

Result after round 4: **2-2-0**

### Result

With 2-2-0 I achieved a sixth place and by this could secure the set champ enchanted promo card - achieved the goal for the set season. Overall we had such a good interaction due to all known players - so it rather felt like a chilled liga event than a hard core set championship.
