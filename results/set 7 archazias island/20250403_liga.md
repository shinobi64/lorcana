## Casual Rounds

### Match 1

First match was with my Amethyst Emerald Discard deck against his Sapphire Steel aggro decklist. In the first game I was able to stall him in the end to remove all options he brought to the board, while in the second match I failed to find the final Bruno or Elsa card to finish from my side.

### Match 2

Second match I switched over to a Ruby Steel challenger list, while Alex opted on the Amethyst Emerald Discard list. I misplayed in game one - which cost me the win, while game two was a a solid take over. Alex list included Merfolk which does not seem to be very strong from my perspective.

#### Game 1

| Player             | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------------ | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me                 | (x)  | 1/3/4/7/10/13  |     |

| Sebastian (bastii) |      | 2/3/5/6/10/13/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Sören and his Amethyst Steel aggro build. In the first game he had it all in sequence - characters, locations and songs. In the second game I could shift early into the Queen to stabilize in between but then his steel removal cards just came flying in.

#### Game 1

| Sören (Brudi) |      | 2/3/10/12/15/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Günther and his Amethyst Emerald Discard Deck. In both games I could get my threats down and have control over his Diablo with my evasive Charakters/ the Brawl removal options.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 2/4/6/8/10/13/15/17/19/20 | (x) |
| Günther (GnF) |      | 1/2/4/5/6/7/8/9/11/12/14  |     |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                      | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------------ | --- |
| Me            |      | 3/5/6/7/10/12/16/19/20         | (x) |
| Günther (GnF) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/6/10/11/12/13/14/15/17 |     |

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

With a 1-2-0 it was confirmed that this deck is niche. It has some good legs in a more challenge oriented meta - but the current Sapphire dominated meta does not allow for this.
