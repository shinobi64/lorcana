## Tournament Rounds

I opted for my updated Ruby Sapphire Control list which is based on more items https://dreamborn.ink/decks/2884mvoW36nVB4MW5skO. I expected a lot of Amber Steel songs deck - and into those it would be a good matchup, while being decent into most other decks as well, with the exception of aggressive decks.

### Round 1

Round 1 paired me Alex and his Ruby Amethyst deck. Alex usually adds some unconventional cards into his deck - so again this time with a lot of 1/3 characters on the early curve to combat the steel meta. We both got our starting games won and then run into the time out.

### Round 2

Round 2 pairing was into Jan from the Battle Bear in Kaiserslautern. He fielded an Emerald Sapphire Song control deck and was able to win in game two. He had as well the win in game three on his hand but gambled it away so we ended in a draw.

Result after round 2: **0-0-2**

### Round 3

Round 3 pairing was into Markus and his Ruby Amethyst variant. I closed game one quickly and in game two it was very very close with me reaching 19 lore before Markus could close out. So we got down into the third game and I could wrap it during the extra turns.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |

Result after round 3: **1-0-2**

### Round 4

Round 4 paired me with Manuel and his Sapphire Steel midrange build. In the first game he got all the answers and could establish the pressure early on - this was not able to catch up onto. In the second game all went into my favor, but I got a bit too gready with drawing cards - so with three consecutive Whole new World casts he decked me out. This loss was the final nail into the coffin of the top 8 cut.

#### Game 1

Result after round 4: **1-1-2**

### Round 5

Round 5 pairing was into Fabian and his Ruby Amethyst deck, which was build around the evasive synergy between Peter Pan and especially the Maui Half Shark. I could outgrind him with card draw and then finally board control and the lore gain by the Lucky Dime.

#### Game 1

#### Game 2

| Fabian (Fabian270188) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/9/11/13      |     |

Result after round 5: **2-1-2**

### Result

A good tournament day with a 2-1-2 result - just one win short of reaching the top 8 cut. It had been a diverse meta with as per my prediction a lot of Amber Steel song decks and Ruby Amethyst bounce decks.

Inkdecks has all the decklists available - https://inkdecks.com/events/view/298379

Anni had a mixed run with a 2-3-0 result and making it to rank 20.
