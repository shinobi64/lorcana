# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga

Regular liga event in constructed format. Eighteen players showed up for the regular liga event https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/289939 on the last day before the Easter break.

## Casual Rounds

This week just a short testing cycle before the tournament as I could not be there as early as I wanted.

### Match 1

First match was with Pierre and his current iteration of Emerald Sapphire lockdown. I opted for my Ruby Steel challenger build as I still enjoy playing it - despite the fact it's not as competetive as I'd like it to be.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Ole and his Emerald Steel midrange setup. This is a tough matchup as Ole is a very experienced player and his deck is slighly favored into my list - especially with the Diablos and the steel control tools included. It was closer as Ole may have expected the overall match to go and we were the last pairing in the first round to play - so we got a lot of audience in the end.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount                | Win |

| Me        | (x)  | 2/4/7/11                 |     |
| Ole (keo) |      | 2/4/5/7/9/11/13/15/17/20 | (x) |

| Ole (keo) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/12/14/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Anni and the Amethyst Emerald Discard styled deck. I got into a better start and she could not find the Diablo line in both games, so I could go with a wide board and use my higher lore pressure to close the games.

#### Game 1

| Player         | Play | Lorecount   | Win |

| Me             |      | 2/3/5/14/20 | (x) |
| Anni (ITFairy) | (x)  | 1           |     |

#### Game 2

| Player         | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| -------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |

| Anni (ITFairy) | (x)  | 1/3/6/8/9      |     |

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Nadine, who was for the first time in Hockenheim, as she usually plays in Kaiserslautern in the Battle Bear store. She is a long term Ruby Amethyst player and had some interesting card choices in her deck. In the first game we came into the late game and she could bounce the control red ladies so I was running out of options. In the second and third game I could get my control cards down fast so even the Be Prepared plays were not slowing the result down.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Me            |      | 3/5/7/9/11/14/16/18      |     |
| Nadine (Dini) | (x)  | 1/3/6/7/9/11/12/14/19/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount      | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/5/8/14/18/20 | (x) |
| Nadine (Dini) |      | 1              |     |

#### Game 3

| Player        | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me            |      | 2/5/7/8/13/16/20 | (x) |
| Nadine (Dini) | (x)  | 1/2/3/6/7        |     |

Result after round 2: **2-1-0**

### Result

With the 2-1-0 result the deck once more prooved that it's a good second tier. Especially if opponents do not know what awaits them and how certain control cards play it can be a good choice. Given the number of evasives going around as of now it may be needed to add in some evasive counters though.
