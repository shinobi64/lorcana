# Card Club Hockenheim - Weekly Lorcana Liga

Regular liga event in constructed format. Fifthteen players showed up for the regular liga event https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/295275 as last chance before the large event in Ravensburg on the weekend.

## Casual Rounds

Not much time this week again before the actual tournament. Still a bit of casual play and meta prediction discussions.

### Match 1

First match was with Manuel and his updated version of Sapphire Steel Wheel - which is mainly build around Cogsworth and higher ink cost characters like Tinkerbell and Hades. The list includes multiple Grab Your Sword cards to control/ as well adresss aggressive decks. I opted for an Amethyst Steel list which is build around Peter Pan and some more control cards.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Ole and his Emerald Steel midrange setup. I was able to use the Pete lock plays and had my removal in time to disrupt his game plan in both games.

#### Game 1

| Player    | Play | Lorecount               | Win |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------------- | --- |
| Me        | (x)  | 1/2/4/5/6/8/11/14/17/20 | (x) |

| Ole (keo) | (x)  | 1/3/4         |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Manuel - like in the pre games - and his Sapphire Steel Cogsworth list. I was able to run in game one and three, while Manuel could play down the Cogsworth, Hades and Tinkerbell combination to lock me out from questing.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount                              | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- | --- |

| Manuel (Hetti89) | (x)  | 1/2/5                                  |     |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me               |      | 1/2/4/5/7     |     |

| Manuel (Hetti89) |      | 2                           |     |

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Phillip and his updated Ruby Amethyst evasives list. This includes the Peter Pan Shadow Finder and Maui combination. His list includes a few unusual cards and the matchup did not feel winable over both games.

#### Game 1

| Player                | Play | Lorecount                     | Win |
| --------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- | --- |
| Me                    |      | 1/3/4/7                       |     |
| Phillip (Swordinator) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/7/9/13/14/15/16/17/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                         | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | --------------------------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/3/4/6                           |     |
| Nadine (Dini) |      | 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/9/12/13/14/16/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **2-1-0**

### Result

While 2-1-0 secured me the third place - deck deck felt very weak into the Ruby Amethyst matchup - while all other matchups are pretty good.
