### Round 1

Round one paring was with Lucy and the Amber Emerald aggro deck. The good thing is here my coils came in on time and the Sisu and shift Sisu could take out nearly all threats.

#### Game 1

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Mathias Jan and the Sapphire Steel aggro build. I could win the first round, got closely beaten in game two but had no draw luck in game three. Still the match felt winnable.

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Alex and his Emerald Amethyst tempo deck - a huge threat against my deck, especially if the Merfolks come down early and in masses - and as usual they did.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

With a 1-2-0 it was given the matchups ok - both losses have been close and could easily swing into the other direction.
