# Wizards Well - Archazia's Island Release Event

As per tradition the Wizards Well hold a release event as sealed on the Saturday following release Friday. With 16 players there was a good attendence - https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/246777.

## Tournament Rounds

My sealed pool was a bit better than on Thursday, finding at least two evasive cards, but still not very optimal as the top curve was not good.

### Round 1

Round one was against Andre, who had been able to pull two Snow White cards in his pool - which again made the games like no games.

### Round 2

Round two was against Matthias, who was overall not very happy with his sealed pool, but had the shift line Hiro and Baymax synergy included - it just popped off once.

### Round 3

Round three paired me into Phillip, who had a good pool with Mother Gothel and the ability to move damage. In the fist game this worked very well, however in the two other games I could place my evasives in early and he did not found the Gothel.

### Result

Overall a lot of excitement on the new cards. Some cards are fully broken in sealed/ limited and make it very imbalanced. Still we had some good pulls as a family and enjoyed our games.

Fiona was a bit disappointed that she finished behind me in the final ranking, but still she did very good throughout the whole tournament. Anni was happy with the cards, but not fully with her play.
