## Casual Rounds

Before and during the tournament some constructed play took place to prepare for the upcomming bigger tournaments.

### Match 1

First match was with Nathalia and her Amethyst Emerald evasives deck. I opted for some fun with the Emerald Ruby Queen of Hearts damage based deck. With the high amount of evasives I was a bit challenged, despite the general line of the Queen deck would work quite good here.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Manuel and his Amber Sapphire Princess/ Aggro deck. This included Alice, Daisy and as well locations like Neverland and McDuck Manor. As he could get off to very first starts it was important to me to get early board control with the Mauis and Sisu and Shift Sisu.

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Andre D. and his Amber Steel songs deck. In the first game I got a bit too greedy in the end and was close to a deck out - but luckily he could not get to his last A Whole New World. I was able to bring in my good control cards, while he was loosing speed especially in the mid game section.

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Andre H and his Ruby Amethyst deck. I mistook it initially for Sapphire Steel / Amethyst Steel and played the first game a bit wrong. In the second game I was not able to generate card draw, while he could slam Library after Library onto the board.

Result after round 2: **2-1-0**

### Round 4

Round four pairing was with Matthias and his Ruby Steel Challenger deck. In the first game I was again stuck on no cards while he quested happily away for a victory. Second and third game then got me going better, so I could turn them around in typical control fashion.

| Matthias (Sigmea) | (x)  | 1/4/7/10/11      |     |

Result after round 2: **3-1-0**

### Result

With 3-1-0 and a good tie breaker it meant second place - only behind Andre (my only loss). Deck felt good and stable, even able to deal with aggressive counter decks. Variance is expected and especially hit in the Ruby Amethyst games. Learning is to be a bit more cautious with the draws to not get too greedy - especially against wheel based decks.
