### Round 1

Round one paring was with Noel and his Ruby Amethyst burn deck. This deck has the ability to generate a lot of lore right out of playing the cards which is a bit scary. It was as well very close in the first game. Second game was fully in his favor and then in the last I could close out quickly.

#### Game 1

| Noel (Apfel7) |      | 1/2/3/5/6/7/8          |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Lukas and his Amber Emerald discard deck. In the first game he could get his combo pieces into play and I could not find the answers in time so he ran away with the game. Both other games were more in favor to me as I could get my pieces onto the board and keep a healthy hand size against his discard actions.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **2-0-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Romwald and his Ruby Sapphire control list. In both games I could outgrind him and play the wheels at perfect times.

#### Game 1

| Player            | Play | Lorecount            | Win |

| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 2/4                  |     |

#### Game 2

| Player            | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                |      | 2/4/6/13/15/17/19/20 | (x) |
| Romwald (Dlawmor) | (x)  | 1/3/5/7/8            |     |

Result after round 3: **3-0-0**

### Result

3-0-0 was a perfect result for the deck. However there was no real steel builds available to test against. However we all had a fun time and will come back for the next week liga event.
