# Wizards Well - Weekly Lorcana Liga

The first liga event in the new set started with a draft event. In total 12 players had been there including Oli. Melee details on https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/264142.

## Casual Rounds

Before and during the tournament some constructed play took place to prepare for the upcomming bigger tournaments.

### Match 1

First match was with Manuel using my Ruby Sapphire control list based on the original DKP approach. Manuel was running on an adjusted version of Amber Steel aggro without the dwarven mines but instead the Penny for additional heal and resist.

### Match 2

In the second match I switched over my decks to an Emerald Steel discard variant. However Manuel had the best draws possible, twice evading my Ursula by just drawing afterwards into the songs. Same for perfect timed Pete draws.

### Match 3

Last casual match was with Patrick and his Ruby Steel Challenger deck. I opted for the Ruby Sapphire item based deck. In the first game I was not able to find suitable characters nor in time the be prepared. Second game was then more solitaire like as I could get my workshops going for near infinite card draw.

## Tournament Rounds

Drafts have been done on two different tables, then with cross pool pairings.

### Round 1

Round one paring was with Nico, who was there for the first time since a while back. He was able to draft quite a number of string cards and had very good draws into evasive counters on time in both games. So there was no chance to run away with my evasives for a win.

#### Game 1

| Player           | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/3/4/8/10/12/11/13/14 |     |
| Nico (nicoHagel) |      | 1/3/5/8/9/12/17/20     | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player           | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me               | (x)  | 1/2/3/7/9/11/10        |     |
| Nico (nicoHagel) |      | 1/2/4/8/12/14/17/19/20 | (x) |

Result after round 1: **0-1-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Andre G. - he as well got a lot of good draws during his game even bringing out combo cards, despite only having them once in the deck only. Again it felt like having no chance to get the games onto my side.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount          | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/4/5/6/7/8        |     |
| Andre G (AMS) |      | 1/3/5/9/8/13/16/20 | (x) |

#### Game 2

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Me            | (x)  | 1/2/4/5                   |     |
| Andre G (AMS) |      | 2/3/4/3/4/5/9/11/13/17/20 | (x) |

Result after round 2: **0-2-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Patrick. It was the first game, where I could get my evasive chain running and taking the clear lore leads. There was no obvious chance from Patrick to come back into both games.

#### Game 1

| Player               | Play | Lorecount              | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Me                   | (x)  | 1/2/3/8/11/15/13/15/20 | (x) |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) |      | 1/2/5/6                |     |

#### Game 2

| Player               | Play | Lorecount            | Win |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------------- | --- |
| Me                   |      | 1/2/3/2/5/6/11/18/20 | (x) |
| Patrick (Marzipan87) | (x)  | 1/3/4/6/8/9/10       |     |

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Round 4

Final round pairing was with Oliver. His draft was nearly a theme deck around the puppies. These puppies have some interesting synergies, but weak willpower and strength. So I could challenge in with my better statted cards easily into it and build up lore leads.

#### Game 1

| Player                     | Play | Lorecount     | Win |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ------------- | --- |
| Me                         |      | 1/4/8/13/20   | (x) |
| Oliver (OliverSaeuberlich) | (x)  | 1/2/3/4/5/6/8 |     |

#### Game 2

| Player                     | Play | Lorecount        | Win |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --- |
| Me                         |      | 1/4/5/8/13/19/20 | (x) |
| Oliver (OliverSaeuberlich) | (x)  | 3/4/5/6/7/8      |     |

Result after round 2: **2-2-0**

### Result

With a 2-2-0 record it was kind of a mixed bag - I originally thought with the good amount of evasives and the Snow White I had a good setup - but if this would not pan out, then it was hard to establish board control, as the characters were too weak. In addition I was lacking some card draw to consistently go up to the seven ink required for the big bodies.
