### Round 1

#### Game 1

| Matthias (Sigmea) | (x)  | 1/4/7/9/11/13/14/15/16/17 |     |

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was pairing with Nico and his Sapphire Steel aggro deck. He won the dice roll and could curve out nicely in games one and three, especially having in those two games a lot of early removals combined with Alice and Anna - a kind of unstoppable lore force.

#### Game 1

Result after round 2: **1-1-0**

### Round 3

Round three was a pairing with Andre G and his Amethyst Steel aggro deck. He could not capitalize on his evasives as I drew very good into my removal songs to keep the board at bay and then just quest out with the two Tamatoas.

#### Game 1

| Player        | Play | Lorecount                 | Win |

#### Game 2

| Andre G (AMS) | (x)  | 1                 |     |

Result after round 2: **2-1-0**

### Result

With 2-1-0 and a slighly worse tie breaker I reached the 3rd place and was quite happy on my overall result. The games prooved to be fund and entertaining.
