# Ostlore Caggtus Leipzig

Regular liga event in constructed format. Twenty players showed up for the regular liga event https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/285490

## Casual Rounds

Before the event I tested a few matches together with Alex as he was there early.

### Match 1

First match was with my Amethyst Emerald Discard deck against his Amber Steel songs decklist. In the first game I could not get the songs quick enough out, while in the second game it went all according to plan and I could widen my board and drag his songs out using Ursula.

### Match 2

Second match I switched over to a the post ban Ruby Sapphire control list, while Alex switched to Emerald Steel discard. I could get my stuff on the board and had some reasonable card draw effects - that helped to establish the control.

## Tournament Rounds

I tested the Ruby Sapphire control deck already a bit, so I tried out a more aggressive deck for the event - especially to have a bit ease of mind and not grindy games all night long

Result after round 1: **1-0-0**

### Round 2

Round two was with Andre and his Amethyst Sapphire Blruple deck. I could get into aggressive starts - however the top deck of a Madame Mim Fox changed the game to let Andre get back into control.

### Round 3

Final round pairing was with Sebastian and his Emerald Steel discard deck. In the first game the second Hidden Cove wrecked my game plan, while in the second game I could get his songs out using my Ursula in time to establish my board. Third game was close, but as soon as he could sing with Ursula it was over.

Result after round 2: **1-2-0**

### Result

With a 1-2-0 it was confirmed that this deck is niche. It has some good legs in a more challenge oriented meta - but the current Sapphire dominated meta does not allow for this.
